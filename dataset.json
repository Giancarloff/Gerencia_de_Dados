    "description": "You can’t let out a breath. The creature is only inches away. Its sole purpose - to feed off your terror. And so you crouch in the dark, trying to stop the fear rising, trying to silence what lies within you.\n“I know you. I know what you're capable of.”\nIn Amnesia: Rebirth, you are Tasi Trianon, waking up deep in the desert of Algeria. Days have passed. Where have you been? What did you do? Where are the others? Retrace your journey, pull together the fragments of your shattered past; it is your only chance to survive the pitiless horror that threatens to devour you.\n“Do not allow yourself anger, do not allow yourself to fear.”\nTime is against you. Step into Tasi’s shoes and guide her through her personal terror and pain. While you struggle to make your way through a desolate landscape, you must also struggle with your own hopes, fears, and bitter regrets. And still you must continue, step by step, knowing that if you fail you will lose everything.\nFirst-person narrative horror experience\nExplore environments and uncover their histories.\nOvercome puzzles that stand in your way.\nCarefully manage your limited resources, both physical and mental.\nEncounter horrific creatures and use your wits and understanding of the world to escape them.\nCopyright © 2020 Frictional Games",

    "description": "For years, you have trained to become an Imperial Battlemage, learning the ways of magic and combat to serve and defend the Emperor. Now, as your final test, you must complete the dreaded Battlespire, facing the challenges that lie within. As you enter the proving ground, however, something doesn’t feel right. You soon discover that Mehrunes Dagon, a Daedra Lord, has invaded and ravaged the Battlespire, killing all in his wake. You are the last hope and although ill-equipped and unprepared, it's up to you to stop Dagon’s plan and restore the Battlespire to Imperial control.\nOriginally envisioned as an expansion for The Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall, this installment was instead released by Bethesda as a stand-alone title. Although still within the Elder Scrolls world and brimming with many loved elements, Battlespire is unique in several aspects; rather than open-world exploration, the game emphasises survival, taking players through 7 levels, including various realms of Oblivion. There are also no shops or merchants, leaving players to salvage whatever they can from their fallen foes. Full character and stat customisation are still a key component of gameplay, as is the ability to craft spells on the fly and the game is full of the lore and characterisation for which the series’ is renowned. Can you defeat Dagon and prove you are worthy of serving the Emperor?\nBethesda Softworks ™ Battlespire ™ are trademarks of Media Technology Limited Copyright © 1994-97 Media Technology Limited.

Here we join Sylvester \"Sly Boots\" Bucelli--a down on his luck PI--and a cast of 6 other unlikely heroes on their quest to discover who or what is trying to destroy the universe. They are the only ones that believe it is happening, and the only ones that can do something about it.\nThis title is a very unique game in many ways. The combination of jRPG style turn-based combat, extraordinary characters with their own personalities, an epic and brilliantly told story, colorful graphics, and absolutely hilarious humor is something very rare. You will travel through galaxies, explore bizarre planets, and journey through space and time. There are no easy choices in this game, no obvious, predictable events, no black and white characters. This complexity made the game well reviewed--it has showed up on PC Gamer's Top 100 PC Games list three times!--and will keep you fascinated and amazed for many hours.\nGreat mix of Japanese and Western style RPG elements with great humor, a gripping story, and a very unique cast of characters.\nExcellent storytelling via professional-quality cutscenes and dialogue will accompany you through the entire 50+ hour long adventure.\nHuge world to explore with many secrets to discover and mysteries to solve. One playthrough is, by far, not enough to see it all.\nAnachronox © Ion Storm LP, 2001",

Get challenged by dangerous mutants and build your own boss-fight strategies together with a friend. And the best part is that you can always switch to single player mode if your pal is not around.\nA mind-blowing dystopia\nThe story is set in a highly detailed game world, told in stunning hand-drawn animated cutscenes, and elaborated in dialogs full of irony. Tragic and intriguing fates of the supporting characters will immerse you into the human world of the far future, where moral and ethical issues trouble the mind more than ever. Search for the truth and prepare for incredible twists and turns.\nUnique visual style\nThrough the artistic lens of 80-90 retro sci-fi aesthetics, the game carefully renders a variety of futuristic 2D visuals mixed with the dark cosmic atmosphere.",

But the ankh alone is not enough - not as long as he hasn't found the most important part of his body: his heart.\nLife has not been kind to Assil. Only three weeks ago he managed to ward off his death curse. Since then a relationship (with Thara) has hit the rocks and the Ankh was stolen from him (by sinister assassins). Assil sets out to get it all back.\nHe is not the only victim, however - there is another: the pharaoh! One moment he sits on his throne, lazy, sluggish and with a heck of a hangover, the next he is a slave in his own quarry - how could this have happened? And more importantly: how is he going to get out of this without getting killed?\nAnkh: Heart Of Osiris is even more intense and more bizarre as it takes the player even deeper into the lazy world of old Cairo. You'll meet a lot of familiar faces, but there are plenty of new surprises and the same black humor found in the first Ankh.\n© 2009 Strategy First Inc. All rights reserved.

    "description": "Anomaly Warzone Earth is an extraordinary mixture of action and strategy in a reversed tower defense formula. The game tasks you with saving a near-future Earth from an alien onslaught. The invaders have captured several of the world’s major cities, building huge turrets that destroy everything in their path. It’s up to you to lead an armor squad through the streets of cities like Baghdad and Tokyo, planning the route and strategically choosing which units to deploy in order to crush the opposition. Take control of the Commander, whose special abilities and quick thinking will be vital in supporting the squad in its mission as you engage in fast-paced, tactical battle across a story-driven campaign and in two heart-pounding Squad Assault Modes.\nEnjoy innovative game play, mixing action and strategy in a clever twist on the familiar formula--because this time you're attacking the towers. You will need to think both tactically and strategically, choosing the right squad and the best route for each mission. What worked in the last mission might lead you to wrack and ruin in the next one! Extend tactical possibilities by gathering resources to buy new units and upgrade your squad during a battle. The great graphics and audio tie this game up in a neat bundle, and a sure-fire hit with strategy and action fans alike.\nNominee for Best Strategy Game of the Year 2011 on Gamespot and on Game Informer!\nThe first \"Tower Offense\" strategy game ever. It plays like a regular tower defense game, but this time you're the attacker.\nPlenty of tactical possibilities for strategic minds: squad management, deployment planning, and constant cooperation between the troops and the Commander!\n© 2011 11 bit studios S.A.

    "description": "Anoxia Station is a mining management game set in a dystopian near-past. A supervolcanic eruption devastated the Earth’s surface, rendering it uninhabitable. Nations now teeter on the brink of extinction relying on the Terranauts - miners sent into the hellish depths of this dying world-. Their mission: extract petroleum, crucial to sustaining humanity's essential infrastructures and survival.\nIt's 1988 and humanity fights on, as the Earth's state deteriorates. Your crew is part of an international group of Terranauts sent to a demilitarized neutral zone. Heading into extreme depths and braving intense radiation, heat, and shifting rock, they discover an enormous abandoned mining station and information about a massive deposit of crude oil that could fuel humanity's salvation.\nBut first they need to find the deposit. That means enduring conditions in the most inhospitable place known to man, while mining resources to support themselves and the remnants of mankind. The extraction must never halt, no matter the cost.\nMining Beyond the Extreme\nYour goal is to rip apart the dark depths of Earth, producing resources to keep your workers alive and humanity surviving another day. Against you are extreme pressure, heat, radiation, and other incomprehensible dangers lurking deep beneath the decaying surface, across randomized maps that make every playthrough unique.\nEvery turn brings new challenges, forcing difficult decisions and careful consideration of circumstances. Every injury or death reduces the size of your crew permanently, while the pressure pulls them ever closer to the brink of snapping and endangering the whole station.\nEach strip-mined and secured sector brings the entire crew closer to the fabled oil deposit. But the deeper you go, the more dangerous the environment becomes, bringing new dangers, new rules of survival, and new discoveries to make for the sake of mankind.\nThe Darkness Within\nThe end of the world did not end humanity or its wars. Your crew might bring together specialists from the Soviet Union, the United States, the German Democratic Republic, Japan and beyond, old rivalries die hard. Everyone has their own agenda and ambitions, even in the dark deep beneath the surface.\nChoose the leader of the mining station and their crews. The team you set up alters the game - specially their secret goals. As the station continues its search, the greatest enemy might turn out to be your fellow man.\nRemember, you´ll need to keep them alive. Crewmen might become despicable, but if they fall, entire production lines might be extinguished, spelling hardship, if not death for the whole mission.\nDecayed Beauty\nThe forbidden depths of the Earth are a place of beauty, where pressure, heat, and titanic natural forces created wonders: caves made of quartz crystals, giant lakes of magma, vast salt caves and rivers of moonmilk, all depicted in a uniquely isometric style grounded in real physical processes.\nThe soundscape evokes the horror of working in this environment, a mix of the deafening roars of shifting rock, the harsh sounds of mining and welding, the distant clicking of something clearly inhuman, and a familiar scream.\nNobody from the surface will hear you scream. Whatever you do down here though, may save them.\n© 2025 Abylight Studios – Developed by Yakov Dmitri Butuzov",

You're going into combat against the best the enemy can offer, but you've got the most advanced fighting helicopter in the world at your fingertips, packed with a devastating array of lethal weapons and state-of-the art technology.\nYou're ready to rock and roll but so is the enemy! They're waiting for you with combat helicopters of their own, backed up by radar-guided anti-aircraft guns and missiles and fixed wing aircraft. It's not going to be a cakewalk but you and your Apache are up to the challenge. Across four theaters of war-- Fort Hood where you train and then in war zones in Cyprus, Yemen, and Korea--you will fly the most fearsome helicopter that has ever been designed against enemies on land, sea, and air.\nApache Longbow took flying simulators to the next level. The developers constructed the flight model with fanatical attention to detail, going so far as to bring in Apache pilots to fly the in-game chopper and offer their feedback on how real the experience felt. Every flight simulator enthusiast will be pleased with the complexity and realism this game has to offer. Meanwhile, to make the game more accessible there is also an arcade mode where the flight mechanics aren't nearly as realistic, but there's still tons of fun to be had. So whichever you are - a slow-and-low hardcore sim fan or someone who just likes to fly about and blow things up - this game has something for you.\nOne of the best AH-64D Apache simulators, made with incredible attention to detail.\nFly solo missions or campaigns in 4 theaters of war, raining down low-altitude death from above!\nHop into the saddle with guns blazing in Arcade mode or benefit from the experience of actual AH-64D chopper pilots' feedback in Realistic mode.",

    "description": "Welcome to Arcade Paradise, the 90’s-fuelled retro arcade adventure. You play as Ashley, and you’ve just been given the keys to the family laundromat. Rather than washing rags for a living, you decide to turn the laundromat into the ultimate arcade. Choose from over 35 games to be in the arcade inspired by three decades of gaming – all of which are playable with high scores to set. Stay one step ahead of your father, manage and invest profits, and build your very own Arcade Paradise!\nRags to riches… literally!\nTake the laundromat business made up of dull chores from washing clothes to throwing out the trash, and turn it into a booming arcade with the coolest games in town raking in all the money!\nInsert Coin\nOver 35 arcade games, each fully realized with its own gameplay, stories, missions and high scores to set! Inspired by 3 decades of gaming, from early vector games right up to the 32-bit era.\nHere comes a new challenger\nInsert a second coin and play against a friend in a number of co-operative & competitive arcade games up to 4 players locally.\nSet the high scores\nProve yourself across each game, set your initials, make your favourite arcade game more popular and upload to the online leaderboards.\nSoundtrack worthy of the cassette collection\nFrom the individual games to choosing what song to put on the jukebox inspired by some of the great records of the early 90s, the soundtrack captures the heart of a bygone era.\nThe greatest gaming era ever\nHello 90’s. If you could smell this game, it would smell like memories. Everything from the look and feel of the arcades, to using the latest PC connected to the mind-blowing dial-up connection, all have been recreated with pure love.\nGerald in the Riviera\nDoug Cockle (famous for his voice acting in Victor Vran and The Witcher series) plays the role of Ashley’s berating father. Being too busy in the Riviera to see King Wash for himself, you will receive many phone calls from Gerald sharing his wise words of advice and constant reminders to fix the toilet.\nArcade Paradise © 2021 Nosebleed Interactive and Wired Productions.

    "description": "At this point, you may wonder what on Earth is this bloody project? Archeo: Shinar, because that's the full title, is a turn-based strategy video game focused on people & resources management.\nIt's not like other games about archeologists doing astonishing stuff in ancient tombs or something like that. No. In this game you will be the man behind the desk. Or a woman. We are talking about the lifestyle of the real archeologists, the true horror of dealing with traumas and phobias. Not yours! You won't risk your own health, we have employees to do that. The true horror of dealing with their traumas and phobias. Do you see where I'm going with it? Imagine the bills from doctors, the health compensations and the press. \"Press? Why the press?\" you ask. Yes, the press. Because you know the press. They are just waiting there for the unsatisfied explorer who would like to tell them how the \"archeology\" truly works. And we do not speak about how it truly works. They can't know the ugly truth. Never!\nThat's a lot of stress, right? Don't worry, as we already know, there is no better medicine for that than a cup of tea. Or a glass of gin. Your call.\nLet's agree this is enough knowledge for now. More information could cause an Epistemophobia, and we don't want that, do we? Please, enjoy the view from your train's window and look forward to our next meeting.\n.-. -.. -... .--. -.. ... / -.... -... --. -... ...-- .. ..-. .---- -....- ..... -... / .-. -.. -... .--. -.. ...\nSigned\nYour Cuppy\nArcheo: Shinar is an economic turn-based strategy set in the world of archeology. It blends the preparation period (turn-based strategy) with expeditions (real-time strategy) in unique gameplay mixup with a lot of small stories and grotesque humor.\nKey features\nPrepare and explore\n- New, fresh gameplay based on mixup of two genres Turn-based strategy and Real-time strategy.\nHire and care\n- Find your best team and keep them in good shape. Or not, you can always replace them.\nMoney and reputation\n- Try to get both. Find a balance between them and be the true winner.\nCollect and invest\n- There's no better way to get rich than by buying land. What's better than having land? Building your own buildings on your land. It's a great investment.\nRead and decide\n- Now and then you will receive a small story to keep your experience interesting. Every time you will have to decide and every time it will have consequences!\nOpponents and Vanessa\n- Meet memorable opponents, you won't forget them for a long time. And there's Vanessa. Such a shame she has a wig.\nSolo or with friends\n- Play solo or with up to 4 friends (hot seat). But keep in mind that after the game they won't be your friends anymore.\nChallenge reality\n- Check the facts, learn more about the history and try to find a proof that the developers were wrong because the world we are going to show you may make you challenge everything.\nDifficult subjects\n- Mental illnesses, addictions, thievery, slavery, paradigms, tribal mentality, corruption, pride, and murder.\nEconomy end bankruptcy\n- Last but not least, do not bankrupt. It's like permadeath. You can withhold salaries only for a certain time, after that they will come. They will come and collect.",

    "description": "Armored Brigade is a real-time tactical wargame, set in a hypotetical confrontation between NATO and Warsaw Pact Allies. As Cold War has turned hot, Europe is once again torn apart by conflict. With this expansion, two new nations,\nCzechoslovakia and Netherlands\n, are added to the cluster of armies of Armored Brigade.\nThe new playable factions introduced by this expansion have different army compositions and organizational structures, adding more tactical options and giving more complexity on the operational level:\nCZECHOSLOVAKIA\nPrior to the 1968 intervention Czechoslovak People's Army was well-regarded both in capability and reliability, and Czechoslovakia was the only Warsaw Pact member that did not have any Soviet forces stationed on its soil up to that point. Offensive warfare was seen as the essential and principal form of combat and the chief instrument to achieve victory over the enemy.\nHowever, the armed forces underwent a political purge after the short period of reform in the late 1960s that culminated in an invasion by the armies of five other Warsaw Pact members. Large number of officers who had supported the reform movement either voluntarily resigned or were forced out. Western analysts disagreed about whether the Czechoslovak armed forces had ever recovered their pre-invasion size, quality, or morale by the late 1980s. Some questioned their reliability in a prolonged offensive war in Western Europe or in a war that was going badly for Warsaw Pact forces. Other outside analysts believed that the Czechoslovak armed forces were well trained, equipped, and motivated and that they were quite capable of carrying their share of Warsaw Pact operations, particularly in defense of their homeland.\nWhile the tactical organization mostly followed the Soviet pattern, there was a degree of local variations and modifications rarely seen in other Warsaw Pact armies. Due to an extensive domestic industrial base predating the communist rule, most of the small arms, crew-served weapons and even vehicles used by the Czechoslovak forces were designed and manufactured locally, sometimes requiring slight changes from the Soviet norm of organization for small units.\nNETHERLANDS\nDuring the Cold War, the Royal Netherlands Army (Koninklijke Landmacht) was committed to two main tasks in the NATO context: participation in the defense of West Germany against ground attacks across the North German Plain, known as “forward strategy”, and ensuring the territorial security of the Netherlands itself and vital lines of communication.\nWhile often overlooked in wargaming next to major powers, such as the USA, West Germany and the UK, Netherlands maintained a sizable army and could deploy an entire corps in West Germany, responsible for the left flank of NORTHAG and the British I (BR) Corps.  They operated a very interesting mix of equipment, ranging from the venerable Centurion tanks to modernized Leopard 1-Vs and state-of-the-art Leopard 2A4s, alongside reasonably advanced YPR-765 infantry fighting vehicle and unique YP-408 wheeled APCs, all supported by modern aircraft and artillery.\nLong-haired, trade-unionised conscripts have often given the Dutch Army a bad publicity and raised eyebrows among other NATO armies, but regular cadres were highly professional (and short-haired); logistics were efficient and equipment modern, although a high dependence on reservists did give cause for concern.\nThe Royal Netherlands Army, in final analysis and despite a few problems, was a modern, efficient, well-led and relatively large force seemingly capable of meeting its responsibilities once fully mobilized and deployed in its wartime locations.\nFEATURES\n- Two new factions: Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands\n- More than 200 new units and aircraft\n- A new map located in the Plzeň Region, Czechoslovakia\n- A linear campaign inspired by the events of the Prague Spring\n©2021 Matrix Games Ltd.

    "description": "FRANCE\nJust as the bloodletting of World War I has left the French military a firm believer in the prevalence of firepower over manoeuvre, so did France's defeat by Germany in 1940 led it to a similar swing in the direction of mobile warfare. Beginning in the 1950s, the French military began to experiment with organizational structures aimed at facilitating rapid battlefield manoeuvre, including the Javelot brigade and the 7e Division Mécanique Rapide, eventually being standardised as the Division Type 1967. However, shortages of modern equipment, caused in part by the economic crisis of the early 1970s and the expense of the French nuclear deterrent, meant that the mechanized divisions that were to follow the new divisional blueprint were being constituted only very slowly. Although France was not officially part of NATO's command structure since 1966, there was an understanding, formalized by regular joint exercises in West Germany, that France would go to the aid of NATO should the Warsaw Pact attack.\nA striking feature of the French formations of 1970s is the extent to which they were tank-heavy, due to their intended mode of operations. Their tactics were closer to US Armored Cavalry Regiments (or, indeed, their own pre-WW2 Division Légère Mécanique) in that they were not intended for holding ground. Like the DLM of 1940, the mechanized regiments were to operate like the earlier dragons portes, locating and delaying the enemy and preparing the situation for a counter strike by the tank regiments. However, during the 1980s the heavy manoeuvre forces saw an increase in the proportion of infantry, through the attachment of motorized infantry divisions to the corps headquarters, addition of VAB-equipped infantry regiments to infantry divisions, and an increase in the number of infantry companies in mechanized regiments. France has opted to mechanize nearly all of its units, using relatively light, wheeled armored vehicles that can be air-transported as well as driven long distances over poor-quality roads and cross-country (e.g. in sub-Saharan Africa). While lacking the level of protection of main battle tanks, wheeled armor units of the French Army do provide considerable firepower, often equipped with 90mm or even 105mm guns.\nBELGIUM\nAs host to NATO since 1967, Belgium has always placed great importance on functioning as a reliable and credible ally. Despite the small size of its population and demanding colonial commitments, Belgium managed to make a significant contribution to NATO collective defence, deploying half of its Army to the FRG as part of the Belgian I Corps. The remainder of the army comprised the Forces of Interior responsible for the defense of the home territory, made up of regular army units which would be augmented in wartime by the local gendarmerie and reserve forces. In addition, the Forces Interior were supplemented by a regiment of elite para-commandos with two airborne infantry and one commando battalion. However, much of its equipment remained obsolescent; its main battle tank, the Leopard 1(BE) was of 1960s vintage and its M75 and AMX-13 Mod 56 APCs, as well as its Alouette II helicopters were almost museum-pieces from the 1950s. However, the Army went through a modest re-equipment programme through the 1980s; upgrading its APCs and artillery, increasing the numbers of ATGMs and replacing most of the Air Force’s fast jets with modern aircraft. Nevertheless, the Belgian Army of the Cold War remains a very interesting and challenging faction.\nFEATURES:\ntwo new factions France and Belgium\nnew map: Ardennes, centered around Bastogne\noverall more than 200 units",

    "description": "Following World War II, Italy has struggled with negative memories of defeat and mediocre performances, long labouring under the stigma of failure and incompetence. Merely a remnant of a past to be forgotten, war was expressly rejected in the Constitution, but the creation of NATO meant that the Italian Armed Forces were quickly reorganised and expanded within a totally different international framework than before. Preparing for a feared invasion from the east, likely via Yugoslavia, Italy played an important role in the Mediterranean. Still, the country’s strategic culture, a mixture of realpolitik and pacifist tendencies, severely impacted it’s military policies.\nThe Italian Army at first glance might seem under-equipped compared to its NATO peers. However, it should be noted that they were supposed to defend a well-fortified, and mostly rugged mountainous terrain on their eastern border. Moreover, quality of units varied significantly across the Army. Some were better trained or better equipped, for example the famous Alpini mountain troops or selected armoured and mechanised brigades. Nevertheless, a player might still feel being under-gunned or lacking in certain aspects, so his armoured, mechanized or infantry force should be always reinforced by strong support assets. This also means a great care should be given to mobility, flanking engagements, and emphasizing maximum use of terrain cover; providing for a challenging and dynamic playstyle.\nOn the other side of the fence was Yugoslavia. Geographically situated between a NATO anvil and the Soviet hammer, the prospect of invasion would permanently dominate Yugoslav strategic plans. Particularly since witnessing the Warsaw Pact intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1968, Yugoslav military doctrine focused on combining its large field army with the guerrilla experience of the Partisans in World War II. In planning, this would entail the armed forces to conduct conventional warfare along a nationwide front, buying time for reserves and the general population to mobilize. Small Territorial Defence units would engage alongside beside regular troops in their local areas, emphasizing mobility and light anti-personnel and anti-armour weapons.\nBecause armament parity with likely opponents, both in quality and quantity, was hard to achieve, Yugoslavs tried to use limited national defense resources in the most efficient way, rarely if ever squandering even the most obsolete weapons. Units in the game, as well the combat tactics, reflects this strategy. Yugoslavia is a very balanced, all-around force that will perform satisfactorily in every field, but might not always excel. Hence a combined arms approach is extremely important when facing technologically superior forces. And while the center of gravity of the Yugoslav Army are infantry formations that are highly varied, logistically undemanding and survivable, armoured and mechanized are certainly capable of making it tough for any adversary.",

Each character has a range of deadly techniques in his/her arsenal, and players must use these lethal techniques to fight their opponents.\nAs in the original\nART OF FIGHTING\n, however, using a deadly technique lowers a character’s mental-energy gauge. Meanwhile, players can taunt an opponent to exhaust his/her mental energy, and even suppress his/her techniques. Furthermore, an attack will become stronger or weaker depending on exactly when the button is pressed. And even if a player is thrown, defensive action is possible with the timely press of a button.\nAll of this adds up to an intense and nail-biting fighting-game experience not found anywhere else!\n©SNK CORPORATION ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",

The OST is comprised of a massive 57 original tracks, each one exploring Tatreal’s unique take on the much-loved Synthwave genre. Like a long Sunday drive through the alps, the soundtrack takes players on a 4+ hour journey — weaving its way through classic 70’s, 80’s and 90’s homages to acts such as Kraftwerk, Daft Punk, ELO and Cerrone.\nPaying special attention to authenticity, Tatreal employs classic drum-machines such as the Roland TR 707 and Yamaha RY 30, as well as virtual instruments like the Jupiter 8 and Moog Modular. The result is a striking and catchy beatscape that perfectly meshes with the rich ambience players will find themselves speeding through in art of rally.\nTracklist:\nShift\nTurbosupercharger\nThe Perfect Corner\nWind\nRace\nFlat Out\nDrivecraft\nDream Big\nCalm and Storm\nDance with Death\nDon't Stop\nRising Star\nWill I See You Again\nConfidence\nBarriers\nCool and Dangerous\nGo Crazy\nChallenge\nRun\nBreaking Doubt\nSprint\nPatience and Determination\nVictory or Death\nNew Horizon\nPurple Sunset\nNeon\nFull Throttle\nDiligence\nHypnotize\nGear Five\nDreaming in Analog\nThe Thin Line\nGrip and Life\nLeap\nMidnight Stage\nExplosion\nStarfall\nGroup B\nPursuit\nRally Master\nTranscendence\nRemember Me\nForever 80's\nAvalanche\nTriumph\nThe Art of Rally\nChampion\nVista\nKanagawa\nGame Over\nDo It for Takumi!

An award given to the best German pilots of World War I, if you ended up in the sights of a Blue Max plane, you knew your flying days were over.\nTheatre of War\n-\nThe rolling hills of the battlefield lay before you as you carefully move your units into position. The clock is ticking, and the enemy is already attacking the vulnerable city near the center of the board with bomber units. Will you pull off your attack and annihilate the enemy?

Arm yourself with a varied arsenal of weapons and spells to unlock and upgrade, and the magic ability to shoot beams of paint. You’ll begin a journey through wildly different biomes – each is presented in different perspectives and art styles and brings different gameplay mechanics to the experience!\nDEFEAT CHALLENGING ENEMIES\nThe Chromaclysm has broken and desaturated the world. The Chromatic Divinities are enfeebled, powerless to restore Color, the fabric of all life and expression. The Apostles, who serve the Divinities, have proven unfit to lead without their gods. Their respective biomes, called Artos, have descended into chaos. Your choices will determine whether the world will continue on this path of destruction or be saved.\nRESTORE COLOUR\nYour very presence brings back Color to the world, step by step – but you’ll need more than walking to overcome the challenges that lie in front of you. Luckily, you have a vast array of weapons and magical powers at your disposal that you can unlock and upgrade, on top of your ability to shoot beams of Color and create your own spells, to aid you in your journey.\nEXPLORE A UNIQUE WORLD\nEach biome in this world introduces unique themes, playstyles, and creatures: from Warhol-esque pop-art worlds, pixel-art neon-lit scenarios or cubist vector landscapes, you’ll fight against insect swarms, face demons, ghosts, and shadows, or explore impossible, dreamlike places as you avoid deadly tornadoes.\nDISCOVER A BRANCHING NARRATIVE\nWhat kind of world is this, and what happened to all the Color? Who are you, who has the power to refill the world’s vibrant hues? Unveil the mysteries of this world and its history interacting with many original characters, exploring a sprawling branching narrative with multiple endings.",

    "description": "Ascension to the Throne is a turn-based strategy game with RPG elements. In a vast fantasy world the hero will have to pass many tests on his way to victory. Enemies seek to stop players from regaining power and taking revenge. Gain new friends to aid you in reclaiming the throne. Become the King you were born to be - wise, brave and courageous.\nPlayers will act as the last offspring of the ancient family Illiar, which has ruled Eden for ages. But times have changed and traitorous enemies attacked the castle. They slaughtered the prince's family and destroyed the settlement, but they didn't crush his will. A very powerful spell cast by a magician threw the hero far beyond the borders of the country. He was on his own - without relatives, friends, army and without money. He lost everything he was proud of but still he was alive and chose the path of vengeance.\nPlayers will explore a new fascinating world, full of foes and friends. They will have to crush hordes of enemies and find new followers to regain the title and ascend to the throne.\nOpen ended non-linear gameplay\nCombination of real-time movement around the game world and turn-based battles\nLarge-scale tactical battles. Up to 22 squads (up to 16 units in each)\nPlayers are not bounded by separate missions. They can go to any part of the game world and explore it. The game world is integral and players are free to choose any direction\nOriginal concept. The Hero is the player, and instead of giving orders and watching the battles from a safe place, he participates in them by himself.

    "description": "BUILD A NEW HOME\nBuild your survivors a base where they can rest and trade stories between adventures. Farm crops, tame alien beasts, incorporate salvaged technology and fortify your home against hostile intruders\nENGAGE IN DEEP TACTICAL COMBAT\nPrevailing in combat will require more than just point-and-click. A detailed hit simulation and health system will mean that even non-lethal hits can render a survivor unable to go on. Suppressive fire might pin an enemy in place, but the ammunition used up may leave you ill-equipped to fight the next encounter effectively\nDRIVE RESTORED VEHICLES\nIt's a big world out there. To get around you will need better transportation than your legs can provide. One of the things setting Ascent of Ashes apart from other games of this genre is the ability to restore and drive vehicles.\nLEAD YOUR SURVIVORS\nEach survivor has their own unique personality and motivations. As colony leader it is up to you to find and recruit capable survivors to fill gaps in your roster against ever increasing challenges. Can you keep everyone happy, secure and motivated?\nEXPLORE A STRANGE NEW WORLD\nYou will find yourself in an expansive, procedurally generated world filled with different biomes and points of interest. To survive the post-apocalypse you'll have to brave the pre-collapse ruins and the many dangers that they hold.\nCHALLENGE A DYNAMIC AI\nIt's not enough to just have an in-depth combat system with a variety of mechanics. You also need opponents capable of using those mechanics to challenge you. Enemies will possess varying degrees of intelligence. Taking on a disorganized band of raiders will play very differently from fighting a squad of well-trained Remnant soldiers.\nFROM THE ORGINAL CREATORS OF COMBAT EXTENDED\nCombining the deep simulation of classic post-apocalyptical survival titles with the tactical challenge of classic real time and turn-based gems, the original creators of RimWorld's heralded\nCombat Extended\nmod present a fresh take on the colony sim genre that emphasizes exploration, tight balance and strategic gameplay.\nMODDING SUPPORT\nOur team has its roots in mod-making and we've been fortunate to have been part of many great modding communities over the years. That's why with Ascent of Ashes, we want to give something back to those communities. We're building the game's engine from the ground up to be easily extendable, and thanks to our extensive experience in creating mods ourselves we know exactly what kind of support mod-makers need. Ascent of Ashes is a game developed by modders, for modders.",

Travel alongside four companions and a cat in the adventure of a lifetime and one that transcends even the world in this fantasy 2D turn-based RPG!\nStory\nOne year ago, the world of Asdivine was enveloped by a brilliant flash of light. Since that time, the influence of shadow has only continued to grow ever more powerful across the face of the land. And though the event itself was undoubtedly connected with the heavens, few people seem to have realized the far-reaching implications of what transpired.\nNow turning to the present, a surprising revelation awaits a young man by the name of Zack and his childhood friend, Stella, in the capital from a chubby cat claiming to be none other than the Light Deity and declaring the world to be on the verge of a great collapse.\nAlthough skeptical at first, this band of unlikely adventurers soon finds this chance encounter to be only the beginning of an adventure set to not only change their lives, but their fates, as well.\nFeatures\nGroundbreaking Visual Quality\n: The world of Asdivine has been rendered with stunning detail, from meandering clouds to lapping waves, sparkling magic to slithering creatures, and even dynamic skill effects.\nLimitless Customization\n: By taking puzzle piece-like jewels and setting them in a box known as a \"rubix,\" players are able to customize characters in ways like never before!\nLoads of Extra Content\n: The game features plenty of subquests, a battle arena, treasure to dig for, and an enemy guide to collect information for.

    "description": "Ash of Gods: Redemption is a turn-based RPG that combines tactical combat, CCG elements, and a constantly evolving story in which no one is safe from death, including the main characters.\nGAMEPLAY\nAsh of Gods is the story of three separate protagonists rising in response to a centuries-old menace once thought to be mere folklore.\nAsh of Gods’ storyline is constantly evolving in response to players’ choices, sometimes even resulting in death. But, the death of a character is not game over. Instead, the story moves forward with the death of that character and previous choices continuing to impact future events.\nCombat in Ash of Gods is a blend of both traditional turn-based strategy and CCG gameplay. While individual tactics will depend upon the skills and classes of your characters, you will unlock and accumulate cards that have the power to unleash powerful abilities, sometimes altering the course of an entire battle.\nWHAT MAKES ASH OF GODS UNIQUE\nDecisions with Major Impacts\nEvery decision, whether on or off the battlefield, has the capacity to alter the course of events and the fate of your party with major repercussions. But, even the death of your leader is not the end of your journey.\nNo Random Dice Rolls\nThere are no dice throws to determine chance-to-hit or the force of a blow. In Ash of Gods, true tacticians must master the skills of their classes and harness the powers granted by their limited supplies of cards, or suffer the consequences.\nAI that Adapts to You\nAsh of Gods’ AI adapts to your style of play to ensure a consistently challenging experience with no room for cheap tactics or invincible team builds.\nPvP Multiplayer\nChallenge other players and compete for a spot on the leaderboards. Unlock new characters, upgrades, and cards to customize your tactics even further.\nRewards for Risk\nExpend your own HP for a last-ditch attack. Go into battle with a smaller team to get better cards and quicker rounds. Take the shorter, but more dangerous route to save on resources. Ash of Gods rewards those willing to take the risks.\nTHE STORY\nAfter 700 years, peace in Terminum is about to end. The Feast of the Spring Equinox is in full swing when the town bell begins to ring. Captain Thorn Brenin, the bodyguard Lo Pheng, the scribe Hopper Rouley, and many others, do not yet know that the reapers have returned and intend to drown the world in blood so that they may awaken the sleeping gods.\nWritten by the award-winning fantasy author, Sergey Malitsky, Ash of Gods is a story-rich game full of memorable characters, powerful dialogue, and deep lore. Malitsky is currently working on a new novel stemming from the events of Ash of Gods.\nTHE ARTWORK\nInspired by the works of Ralph Bakshi (The Lord of the Rings), classical Disney animation, and the prolific Soviet studio, Soyuzmultfilm (The Snow Queen), Ash of Gods features intricately hand-drawn illustration and animation. Rotoscoping, a technique in which a scene is first filmed with a live actor to use as reference, instills every frame of animation with incredible detail and a true sense of life.\nTHE MUSIC\nThe original soundtrack is a collaboration of Adam Skorupa, Krzysztof Wierzynkiewicz, and Michal Cielecki, whose previous work includes The Witcher, Bulletstorm, Painkiller, EVE Online, Call of Juarez, and Shadow Warrior. Every track was recorded live by professional musicians, often using traditional instruments rarely encountered in contemporary recordings.",

Well, there is no better way to cheer us than to buy us a pint of beer or cup of coffee (depends on the preferences, of course)!\nAurumDust studios guarantee that 100% of the money received through the sale of \"Beer for Developers\" will be spent in pubs during the thought-out of the plot for the second part of Ash of Gods.\nIn exchange, we would like to thank all our supporters: you will receive a full 54-cards playing deck as a high-resolution PNG file with fantastic art of our characters. You can use those cards in roleplay games or just enjoy the art itself (precisely those files were used to produce exclusive physical decks for our Kickstarter backers).\nWe hope that you enjoyed the Ash of Gods!

    "description": "BEFORE YOU PLAY\nBuild winning decks of warriors, equipment, and spells from four different factions in this story-driven tactical card combat game. Battle your way through a series of major tournaments, each with their own opponents, battlefields, and even rules. Earn new cards and upgrade your favorites, then combine them into any number of decks: you’re free to experiment as much as you like! Do prepare carefully for key battles with major characters: you’ll only get a few chances before defeat will change the course of the story, though the game continues…\nAll the while you will meet new characters, have conversations, and make decisions that will affect the fate of the entire world.\nYou play as Finn, a young man whose only hope of preventing a neighboring nation from attacking his home is to master the card game they use to teach aristocrats the art of warfare: the Way. Infiltrate the tournaments they hold, and you can get close to their elite commanders. What you do once you get there will be up to you. Just remember, your decisions have consequences!\nThe core gameplay is deceptively simple: every turn you can play one warrior, and one support card, then all your units will advance towards the enemy and attack if they can! But the challenge comes in what combinations you choose, how you build your deck, and when you hold back cards for a better opportunity. Your opponents play by the same rules… most of the time. Each battle can have different rules or special features that can be exploited by smart deck building!\nWarriors range from front line brutes to fragile archers and supporting spellcasters. Equipment cards buff warriors on the battlefield, while spells can aid your fighters or harm the enemy. There’s no one way to play - build a deck that uses tough fighters with armor and healing to grind down your opponents, roll in with high damage archers and poison wielding bandits to put down enemy warriors before they can even react, and much more. With a huge range of cards to choose from, the number of possible combinations is enormous.\nEVERY BATTLE IS A NEW CHALLENGE!\nEach battle in\nAsh of Gods: The Way\nis a carefully crafted test of your skills with different objectives and opponents. Whether you’re capturing checkpoints, defending your commander from a deadly enemy or fighting a series of one on one duels you’ll need all your wits about you to prevail. The outcome of every battle is significant!\nMake sure to use every detail of the battlefield to your advantage. You’ll encounter traps which can be a danger or an opportunity depending on your strategy, and power runes which could change the course of a battle entirely!\nIf your current tactics aren’t working out, just switch out your cards and upgrades to try something different — there’s no penalty for experimentation or changing strategy.\nCHOOSE YOUR WAY\nAsh of Gods: The Way\nis a novel genre mix of RPG style conversations, a collectible card game, and a turn-based tactical battle — your choices in all of these areas will influence the outcome of your story.\nYou build your deck in\nAsh of Gods: The Way\nwith a combination of character cards and support cards. Your characters are deployed to the battlefield, while support cards boost your characters or cast powerful spells. Both types of card can be upgraded to become stronger, and characters can even gain brand new skills like cunning counter-attacks or armor smashing strikes.\nEach card belongs to one of five distinct factions in the game, all with their own synergies and metagame strengths. Earn new cards by winning battles, buying them, or completing special tasks. You can mix and match faction cards as you wish, or focus on just one — it’s your call — your way.\nINTERACTIVE STORY WITH MULTIPLE ENDINGS\nThe story centers on young Finn who is sent on a dangerous mission that could stop a murderous war… but on his journey he'll learn that some of his enemies are quite different from what he’s been told. There will be hard decisions to make and Finn will have to live with the consequences. In addition to the non-linear main plot, told through (fully voice acted) cutscenes and conversations, there are also side quests to explore.\nEXPLORE OTHER GAMES IN THE ASH OF GODS UNIVERSE!\nAsh of Gods: The Way\nis our second game in the Ash of Gods universe — our first game,\nAsh of Gods: Redemption\nis a turn-based RPG with tactical combat, CCG elements and a heavily interactive story with major decisions to make which are literally life or death. But even if your leader falls it isn’t the end — the story will continue…\nASH OF GODS: THE REDEMPTION\nThere’s even more to discover on\nour website\n! Take a look if you’re interested in games for other platforms. And last but certainly not least, you can join us on\nDiscord\nfor all the latest\nAsh of Gods\nupdates!\n© AurumDust 2023",

It's up to you to decide how to deal with them - fight together against evil, invite them into your party or simply ignore them.\nSouls with a Twist\nAshen\nis faithful to the \"souls\" genre of stamina-based combat, introducing players to a punishing yet satisfyingly vast world. But here’s the twist - no two gameplay experiences are alike. Whether you’re exploring bogs, investigating a fjord or pillaging an old palace, where you are at any given moment will dramatically alter the course of your adventure. It's a brutal open world; you're just living in it.\nCreatures + Combat\nAshen\nhas no shortage of dangerous encounters, from hostile enemies to indigenous creatures. You'll be rewarded for studying the environment and its inhabitants, planning your adventure rather than flying by the seat of your pants. The flora and fauna within the world aren't just fantastical; they're often fatal. Each confrontation, no matter how trivial, has potentially dire consequences.\nCrafting is Key\nAs you discover survivors, you'll have the choice to invite them to your Town. But these aren't mere adventurers - they're potential collaborators, bringing a plethora of crafting skills, from blacksmithing to foraging expertise, in tow.\nStory + Score\nFamed fantasy author Mark Lawrence (\nThe Broken Empire\ntrilogy) and renowned band Foreign Fields collaborated closely with the development team at A44 to craft a cohesive and unique narrative and sound.\n© 2019 Aurora 44, LTD.

Spawn points are placed to keep teammates close together to allow for combined attacks and strategies. Clearly defined resources for each player prevents any fighting over spawn locations or expansion opportunities and keep the maps fair and balanced for everyone.\nJuggernaut DLC\nThe Juggernaut DLC comes with a brand new juggernaut for both the PHC and the Substrate. Each warship is unique and complements the units that are already in the game for a more well-rounded army.\nFeatures\nNew Juggernaut: PHC Agamemnon\n- Designed to annihilate swarms of enemy units and overrun defensive positions, the Agamemnon has the potential to hold territory against waves of enemies for long periods of time. With two rapid-firing laser batteries and tempest missile salvos, the Agamemnon can saturate a wide area with highly explosive shells. Advanced triple-barrel autocannons provide improved defense against air units, but take care when you deploy this ship - it lacks the armor piercing capabilities to be effective against other juggernauts or dreadnought destroyers.\nNew Juggernaut: Substrate Eye of Darkness\n- The ultimate manifestation of the Substrate’s technological superiority, the Eye of Darkness is capable of rupturing the fabric of space and time to destabilize targets at the molecular level. Its full armor-piercing and high area-of-effect attacks make this warship devastating for ground targets. However, be alert: it is the only Juggernaut that lacks any anti-air weaponry, which means that a well-timed slew of bombers could take it down if you don’t plan the accompanying army carefully.\nAshes of the Singularity: Escalation\nThe human race has expanded into the galaxy thanks to the wonders of the technological singularity. You have become so powerful that you can manage vast armies across an entire world that provide you with an ever greater galactic empire.\nNow, humanity is under assault by a new enemy. Calling themselves the Substrate, they seek to annihilate the human race from existence. You, as an up and coming member of the Post-Human Coalition, must deal with both this new menace as well as renegade humans trying to lay claim to their own worlds.\nAshes of the Singularity: Escalation\ntakes everything that was in the award-winning hit strategy game,\nAshes of the Singularity\nand expands on it in every way. Bigger worlds. More players. More units. More story. More everything.\nPlay as the Post Human Coalition or their eternal foes the Substrate and battle for control of the galaxy. Experience maps of unprecedented size and detail with the unparalleled power of the world’s first native 64-bit RTS engine, Nitrous.\nEnjoy the game online with friends in ranked or unranked multiplayer mode or play it by yourself against a powerful non-cheating AI in skirmish or campaign mode. No matter what mode you play, strategy is the key: deciding what technologies to research, where to send your armies, how to manage your economy, and what units to construct are crucial to victory.\nThe new features of Escalation add to the base game and pave the way for even bigger battles, more diverse strategies, and exciting wars across unique worlds and complex maps. The conflict has escalated, and it’s time to choose a side.\nCopyright © 2016 Stardock Entertainment and Oxide Games. Ashes of the Singularity is a trademark of Stardock Entertainment.",

There are plenty of metal and radioactive deposits for you to claim, but you’ll have to defend them carefully to prevent your enemies from overtaking them.\nFreising:\nFace down your enemies on this frozen tundra for up to 4 players. Each base is tucked behind a plateau, obscuring visibility, and other choke points are tactical places for setting up your defenses along the trenches that run through the landscape.\nGibraltar:\nThere’s hardly any room to breathe on this small 2 player map that promises almost immediate action as you fight your opponent for what precious resources are available. The temptation of a single Turinium reactor between you both is almost too much to resist – be careful not to waste too many resources trying to guard it! You might just leave your Nexus defenseless.\nJigsaw:\nWith winding trenches and vantage points for your base atop small plateaus, this small map provides a close-quarters challenge for up to 4 players. Your armies will need to fight for dominance on the combat paths – maybe a coordinated airstrike can turn the tides in your favor while your enemy is distracted.\nNantes:\nUp to 6 players will contend with one another for control on this medium-sized map. Each base sits on unique terrain, from plateaus to craters, and you will need to guard their resources carefully in order to prevent your enemies from gaining an advantage.\nFeatures\nAsymmetrical maps of varying sizes based on actual geographic locations\nNew maps: Dubola, Freising, Gibraltar, Jigsaw, and Nantes\nOvercome challenging geographical disadvantages while battling your enemy\nCopyright © 2021 Stardock Entertainment and Oxide Games.

A mysterious entity known as Nihilon has returned to wreak havoc on the planet Oneiros and has seized control of some of the Substrate consciousnesses residing there. As the Substrate, you must rescue your corrupted brethren and find out what Nihilon has done - as the PHC, your only concern is neutralizing both threats entirely. Which battle will you fight?\nThe Inception DLC\nalso adds a new variety of maps perfect for facing down hordes of computer adversaries or engaging online in some brawls with friends.\nFeatures:\nNew Scenario\nInception - This split scenario lets you choose which faction to play as! An entity known as Nihilon is back and has corrupted all consciousnesses on the planet of Oneiros.

The outcome of the scenario changes based on which faction you choose; play them both to get the full story.\nNew Maps:\nOneiros - Wage war with up to 7 players on this unusual planet. With a strong central starting position, resource-rich but vulnerable north and south positions, and four isolated corner starts, this map is great for a tight free-for-all match.\nBayern - This symmetrical Terran map supports up to 3 players. Each starting location is vulnerable from one direction and the massive metal deposits in the middle of the map are enough to lure even your toughest turtler out of isolation.\nBrasil - This large 10 player ice map challenges you to defend your starting area while you try to make your way to the astoundingly rich central valley without falling victim to your opponent’s attacks.\nPolska - Up to 5 players can brawl on this desert map with strategically critical hills that command the passages between regions.\nCopyright © 2017 Stardock Entertainment and Oxide Games.

Take on the role of a PHC leader and conquer dangerous missions where the odds are stacked against you, or join with the Substrate to repel your PHC oppressors. Engage your enemies on huge new maps, conquer one of the new scenario challenges, and more.\nCore Features\nNew Units\nPHC Atlas - This anti-air, anti-drone frigate is an excellent line of defense against Drone Hives. Since it only costs metal and doesn’t require radioactives, the Atlas is a less powerful, but inexpensive, alternative to the Apollo cruiser.\nSubstrate Tormentor - This indirect fire frigate is capable of saturating an area with artillery shells, causing damage to anything in its radius of attack. Although it lacks accuracy and direct single target damage, the Tormentor is at its most powerful against groups of units rather than structures.\nNew Scenarios\nAscension - The Substrate have developed a prototype experimental Eye of Darkness. Build up your defenses and survive the onslaught of your enemy in order to destroy the weapon before it wipes you out.\nBattleline - A large Substrate army looms across the map, just waiting to attack. Your base is established and ready to go; now, you only need to push out strong units, maintain your resource levels, and survive.\nCarnage [PHC] - You’re ready to make your last stand against the massive Substrate army. In the biggest scenario to date, face down 7 enemy opponents while also helping your 6 allies stay alive long enough for you to claim victory.\nCarnage [Substrate] - You’re ready to make your last stand against the massive PHC army. In the biggest scenario to date, face down 7 enemy opponents while also helping your 6 allies stay alive long enough for you to claim victory.\nDeadlock - The Substrate are making huge pushes toward capturing valuable Turinium mines. Build up your forces and fight off the enemy before they reach critical mass or overrun you.\nEntropy - The members of the Post Human Coalition are attempting to overrun your Substrate base before you gain a critical mass of Turinium. Hold them off at all costs.\nIncursion - The PHC have launched an attack on Substrate territory. You have the initiative, but there’s no one around to help you - you will have to defeat them on your own.\nInflux - Ventrix has tainted the name of the PHC for long enough. Overcome the scarcity of resources and take him out with vicious orbital attacks.\nNew Maps\nBattleline - Medium 1v1 map\nEntropy - Large asymmetric 1v3 map\nOsiris 5 - Large 2v2 with limited choke points through the center\nPallavia - Medium 2v2 with limited choke points through the center\nBattleline Frenzy - Medium, single lane 4v4 for combined defenses and huge clashes of forces\nGalatea - Large symmetrical 10 player map designed for standard 5v5 games\nCaldera - Large symmetrical 12 player map designed for standard 6v6 games\nNashira - Enormous symmetrical 14 player map designed for standard 7v7 games\nCopyright © 2016 Stardock Entertainment and Oxide Games.

    "description": "Expand your strategic options, wield devastating new units, and turtle up with some fierce new defenses in Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation - Hunter / Prey! Haalee and her Substrate army are back with several brand new units that are armed and ready to destroy their enemies. The PHC, not to be outdone, have built up brand new defensive towers to counter the onslaught. Take advantage of the devastating capabilities of the new Heart of the Phoenix juggernaut, entrench yourself in your base and defend yourself with powerful and heavy-hitting Minos Cannons, and much more.\nTo introduce you to the new units and defenses, a brand new scenario focusing on Haalee and the Substrate’s expansion onto a PHC-occupied world is included. For added strategic depth, the new content is available in skirmish mode, as well as certain campaigns and scenarios.\nFeatures\nNew Substrate Units\nClutch of Eggs: Dozens of enemies for the price of one! When destroyed, this mechanical spiderbot overwhelms its enemies with a horde of hatchlings.\nHatchlings: So. Many. Spiders. These quick moving skittering swarms emerge from destroyed spiderbot eggs and can wreak havoc on an unprepared enemy.\nScarab: Slow but hardy, this powerful frigate is perfect for overwhelming enemies with slow-firing, single-target weaponry.\nHeart of the Phoenix: Decimate your enemies with dozens of missiles and a static charge meant to disable nearby units! True to its name, this Juggernaut will regenerate once it’s killed unless the chrysalis it produces is destroyed within a certain time limit.\nFalling Star: Watch out for the electromagnetic pulse. This disruption cruiser will temporarily disable an enemy’s base defenses when it’s destroyed within range.\nSkirmisher: Harass your enemies with this quick-moving cruiser. It engages well against incoming artillery and its speed allows it to out-maneuver most enemies.\nNew Substrate Structures\nAuxiliary Assembly: This new building produces all of the new units, except for the Heart of the Phoenix, which can be built in the Advanced Assembly.\nNew PHC Defenses\nShotgun Turret: Upgraded from the orbitally deployed Emergency Turret, this new defensive building deals massive damage, but has a short range.\nMachine Gun Turret: Versatility is key! Although it isn’t an especially heavy hitter, this turret handles both airborne and ground threats very well.\nMinos Cannon: Mind the lengthy cooldown. It may take some time between shots, but this costly cannon is the ultimate in anti-dreadnought and anti-juggernaut defense.\nNova Tower: Shields up? No problem! Although it deals no hull damage, this bombardment tower provides heavy shield damage in a wide area.\nKinetic Accelerator: Need a boost? This tower increases the damage of all other nearby defenses and units by 15%. Be careful, though - it’s fragile and vulnerable to attack.\nStasis Hammer: Stop - hammer time! This long range defense deals no damage, but can slow an enemy onslaught by stunning its target for several seconds at a time.\nNew Scenario: Hunter and Prey\nHaalee and her Substrate army have designated a new world for themselves as part of their plans for expansion, but there’s just one problem: that planet is already occupied. Now, the members of the PHC already entrenched in their colonies there must find a way to repel the Substrate’s relentless attacks before they are overrun and destroyed.\nFollowing Haalee’s directives, you must guide the Substrate to victory against the PHC. Although you’re outnumbered and the post-humans are deeply entrenched with some devastating new defenses, the latest in Substrate technology is at your disposal.\nMultiple paths lead to the main enemy base, each with different defenses - you’ll have to deploy your armies carefully in order to counter them. Each Nexus you destroy unlocks more of the new units, so build up your reinforcements and destroy all opposition so that Haalee’s plans can be fully realized.\nCopyright © 2019 Stardock Entertainment and Oxide Games.

    "description": "FIGHT\nThe world as we knew it is gone—swallowed by fire, dust, and decay. Stranded in the heart of\nAshworld\n, a post-apocalyptic wasteland, your fight for survival begins. Water and food are scarce, and danger lurks around every corner. The Ragelands are ruled by the ruthless Ragers, merciless road warriors who thrive in chaos. But they aren’t the only threat—the eerie Skellies emerge at night, growing deadlier as time passes.\nSCAVENGE\nFind shelter and scavenge through abandoned skyscrapers, underground bunkers, and scattered ruins for valuable resources. Build, craft, and upgrade your weapons, tools, and gear to stand a chance against the chaos. Engage in intense combat with an arsenal of weapons ranging from chainsaws to plasma rifles. Every step forward is a risk, but standing still is a death sentence.\nSURVIVE\nThe world is vast—travel by foot or drive through the wreckage of civilization in a variety of vehicles, each with unique handling and quirks. Navigate treacherous terrain, uncover hidden locations, and complete story-driven missions and side quests that shape your journey. In\nAshworld\n, the only rule is survival. How long can you last?\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nOpen-World Survival\n– Explore the vast, desolate Ragelands filled with hidden dangers.\nSavage Combat\n– Battle Ragers and Skellies with an array of weapons, including flamethrowers, rocket launchers, and boomerangs.\nScavenging & Crafting\n– Search ruins for resources and craft weapons, tools, and survival gear.\nWasteland Vehicles\n– Drive various post-apocalyptic cars, each with unique handling and challenges.\nMissions that Tell a Story\n– Experience a mix of main quests and side missions that reveal the secrets of Ashworld.\nEvolve to Survive\n– Level up, gain new skills, and become the ultimate survivor in a world that wants you dead.\nThe ashes remember no names. The wasteland has no mercy. Will you conquer the Ragelands, or will you be just another corpse in the dust?\ncopyright (c) 2017 OrangePixel - www.orangepixel.net",

    "description": "Assassin’s Creed\n®\nis a game that redefined the action-adventure genre. With photo-realistic graphics, an advanced physics model, and a nearly fanatical attention to detail, this title was able to begin a new chapter in gaming history. However, the excellent technical aspects are only half of the reason why it became so popular; the other half is the story.\nWhile you technically play the game as Desmond Miles, the main focus of the game takes place elsewhere. The year is 1191: Jerusalem, the middle of the Third Crusade. You are a member of a mysterious order of assassins where you have trained your whole life to do one thing and one thing only – to kill. The recently growing influence of the Order of the Knights Templar disturbs the delicate balance of power in the region and therefore directly threatens The Brotherhood. The clash of the two most powerful organizations in Jerusalem at the time has the most unexpected consequences and triggers devastating events that threaten the world itself, and you – Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad – are in the middle of all this.\nWell-constructed story that will pleasantly surprise you many times along the way.\nImpressive level of interaction with the environment – crowds react to what you do and act accordingly.\nOpen world gameplay lets you to decide how and when to achieve objectives, where to go, and gives you nearly complete freedom to get there.\n© 2008 Ubisoft Entertainment.

    "description": "Astrea is a DICE-deck-building roguelike that flips the script on deckbuilders by using dice instead of cards and an unique dual “damage” system: Purification vs Corruption. Build a dice pool strong enough to purify Astrea's out-of-control corruption and save the Star System.\n•\nUnique dual “damage” system: Purification vs Corruption -\nIn Astrea there is a new type of “damage” system. Purification can be used to damage enemies or heal yourself. On the other hand, corruption can be used to damage yourself or heal the enemies. Pacify enemies through Purification, or Corrupt yourself to unleash abilities that help tip the scales.\n•\nDynamic Health Bar system -\nWith skills attached to your health bar, you can take Corruption to enable these skills and unleash powerful abilities. But be careful, if you take too much Corruption you will be consumed by it.\n•\nNot cards, but dice! -\nBuild a dice pool that fits your playstyle. Choose from over 350 dice and three dice types; reliably safe, perfectly balanced, or powerfully risky. A dice type system designed with high-risk, high-reward in its core.\n•\nCustomize your dice -\nForge your fate by editing die faces with new actions, tipping the odds of powerful results into your favor.\n•\nChoose from Six Brave Oracles -\nEach possessing their own unique dice sets, abilities, and playstyles. From ingenious spellcasters to brutish berserkers, whether you like beating the opponent into submission or outsmarting them with clever plays, there’s an oracle for you.\n•\n20 Upgradeable Support Sentinels -\nEnchanted constructs that offer supportive dice rolls making them reliable companions in the heat of battle.\n•\nUncover Over 170 Modifying Blessings -\nImbue your Oracle with unique passives yielding potent effects that change up your fundamental tactics. Choose between Star Blessings, passive effects with lower power, or Black Hole Blessings, powerful passive effects with a drawback.\n•\nMore than 20 random events\n- Find mysterious locations that can change the course of your run.\n•\nManipulate your enemies and control your fate -\nEnemies attack using their own die, making it possible for you to manipulate their die to change their intent.\n•\n16 Difficulty Levels -\nCustomize your experience using difficulty levels to test all your abilities.\nLong ago - when ancient ruins were once flourishing civilizations and their populace lived in idyllic bliss - a mystical star governed all. Loyal disciples, called Six-Sided Oracles, were blessed by their star, granting them the strength to seal away the gift of heavenly bodies within mystic relics.\nAll was perfect and harmonious, until that one fateful day - The Crimson Dawn Cataclysm. A ferocious inferno sundered down from the sky, engulfing the entirety of the star system, crumbling the foundations of their society and corrupting the souls of the weak-willed. The disciples of the star were lost to the chaos - their creations scattered across a vast world of ruin. Could there still exist those who were capable of wielding their power?\nEons later, descendants of the Six-Sided Oracles embark on a journey to finish the failed battle that their predecessors started and save their star system.\n© 2022 Little Leo Games",

    "description": "Play as ‘Doctor’ Simon Forman - unlicensed medical professional and astrologer - and help him win a medical licence. Astrologaster is a narrative-based comedy game.\nExplore Forman’s life, his work, and his relationships with his clients. Make story choices by performing astrological readings. Choose strategically or make decisions just for fun - but be aware that your choices will have consequences (and unpredictable side effects!)\n13 clients come to see you 5-7 times seeking advice for personal, professional and medical problems. By examining the stars in the sky, you diagnose and determine answers for your clients’ problems. As well as affecting the storyline, these choices will alter your clients’ satisfaction levels. Satisfied clients will write you letters of recommendation, and with enough of these letters you can obtain a medical licence from the University of Cambridge.\nSo-called “real” (licensed) doctors call Forman a quack and fraud. Help Forman prove these medical establishment elitists wrong!\nFeatures\nPerform real* astrology:\nExamine the sky and choose astrological interpretations that Forman will use to advise his patients. (But remember: astrology is not an exact science!)\nSolve Hilarious Problems:\nConsult on problems ranging from Elizabethan terror plots and foul diseases, to romantic entanglements and stolen pies!\nChange Lives:\nWin your patients’ favour or ruin their lives. Advise 14 characters who return 5-7 times. Patients have their own ongoing stories which often overlap with each other. Use gossip from some characters to guide and manipulate others.\nWin A Medical Licence:\nConvince patients to write letters of recommendations. Collect enough letters to exchange them for a medical licence.\nFully Voiced Character Dialogue:\nSitcom-style comedy brought to life by a cast of over a dozen actors.\nSing Along:\nEnjoy Renaissance-era music and sing along to each character’s theme song.\nCasebooks Come Alive:\nSimon Forman’s cases are presented as a beautiful pop-up book. Turn pages to delve deeper into your patients’ stories.\nThe Story\nLondon, 1592.\nA great plague sweeps through the capital. When doctors flee the city in fear, a hero rises. His name is Simon Forman, “Doctor” of Astrology, Astronomy and Physick. Not only does he have the power to cure the sick, he can find their lost pets and predict their futures! All by reading the movements of the stars.\nBut when the plague ends, Forman’s problems begin. The real doctors return to London and they will stop at nothing to bring him down...\nSummary\nAstrologaster is a story-driven astrological comedy game set in Shakespeare’s London. Based on a true - and truly ridiculous - story.\nSimon Forman was considered a sage by some and a charlatan by others. What will your legacy be? Will you put your faith in the stars?\n© 2019 Nyamyam Limited. All rights reserved.",

    "game_title": "Astrox Imperium",
    "description": "This game is currently in Early Access.\nLearn more about early access.\nVisit the forums and learn more about this game.\nAstrox Imperium is my attempt to create the space game that I wanted to play, but no one had created. I wanted a single player, open-world space game that is similar to games I enjoyed, like Homeworld and EVE, with economies, factions, and a story. A game where I could set all the parameters, and the universe would come alive with new challenges each time I played. I tried to take the best of what I liked from many of my favorite space games, and combine them into something simple but deep, familiar yet fresh, and enjoyably addicting to play.\nThe human struggle to survive is an all too familiar one. As the planet collapsed into an ecological depression, mankind as a whole is forced to expand his vision to the skies. A grand ship was built, and the ‘Imperium’ was scheduled to launch mankind into the future. With a new Quantum technology at its core, the Imperium was mankind’s greatest achievement. Putting aside all differences, the people of world came together. Under a common goal, the efforts of an entire generation came to fruition. The Imperium was ready to carry the dreams of us all, and with it, the hopes of finding a second chance.\nNot any one person knows the whole truth, but from what can be gathered, here is what we know. The Imperium was destroyed, and many of the human pioneers perished during the event. The survivors congregated together and began to build a temporary home from the wreckage of the ship itself. At first they waited for rescue, but it wasn’t long before the first ones accepted their fate.\nIt has been 230 years now, and mankind has been quite busy out there in the stars. The story of the Imperium, passed down through the generations, have all but faded away completely.\nThe main game play loops are fairly simple, and familiar. What makes Astrox Imperium unique, is the way that you can easily glide between the various loops to maintain a nice level of progression, without it feeling any more ‘grindy’ than you want it to. Sure, you can just mine rocks if you want, but Astrox Imperium provides you many different ways to progress your pilot.\nAs with most space games of this genre, mining is a big mechanic of Astrox. It is the easiest way to earn credits, and most players are familiar with how it works. You can also complete contract missions. These are randomly generated missions that offer a variety of task and objectives to complete. Some of these contracts are combat missions that will involve raiders, pirates, and sometimes regular npcs. The combat missions offer a bit more action to an otherwise relaxed game. The rate at which you choose to progress is up to you. You are given a number of game options allowing you to adjust 'the grind' and speed of the game. There are a number of small, interesting little mechanics sprinkled throughout the game that were given a lot of thought and care, but you will not find anything groundbreaking or innovative here. This game is meant to feel comfortable and familiar. The game play loops are designed to be simple enough to understand quickly, and complex enough to enjoy over many hours of play.\nMany of the classic mechanics from the space game genre have been incorporated into Astrox Imperium. Basic interface controls were designed using elements from some RTS and FPS games. All the fan favorites and core game play elements have been included; mining, crafting, trading, refining, fleets, combat, exploration, survival, and more. This game will seem familiar to fans of the space survival / exploration game genre. Here is a list of features that are currently in the game. Check out our community forum if you are looking for more information about upcoming features.\nBasic Features Overview\nAll features listed here are currently in Development\nNon-linear Story - Choose your own adventure... The ending is in your control.\nOpen World - Free to do as you please, go where you want, do what you want.\nExploration - Over 100 maps to explore, each with unique resources, stations, structures and secrets.\nFlight - You can fly your ships with the mouse, WASD, or point and click. (Partial controller support)\nCamera Control - You have full control of the camera. 3D rotational focus, first and 3rd person , and follow behind views with lots of options.\nMining - 12 different types of resources to collect.\nSkills- 100+different skill to train.\nRefining - Break down ore into raw materials and components used for crafting.\nCrafting - Use those raw materials and components to create new items.\nTrading & Economy - Profit from the simulated economy with trade.\nMissions - 15 unique mission types. Contract missions for the 18 game factions.\nFactions -18 factions, ratings effect all areas of life in the Astrox Universe.\nCombat - Real time, dynamic, tactical and strategic. hundreds of weapons, ECM, drones, bombs , ships and more.\nSmart AI - Intelligent, and plays by the same rules are you do.\nLife support -expand your range of exploration, manage and upgrade your life support systems.\nShips-Currently over 70 ships and growing.\nDrones -10 unique drones , each with special abilities. Automate their control, or manually manage their tasks.\nFleets - Build a fleet of up to 10 Merc ships. Command and control their actions individually or as a group.\nWhat to expect during Development phase of Astrox Imperium\nThe addition of Structure fabrication.\nNew mechanics to allow for towing large objects thru space.\nThe ability to anchor large objects.\nThe ability to retire a Merc into an administration position of a station.\nAdministrative Mercs will generate revenue and bonuses based on their position and location.\nA complete story line for each of the 6 main factions\nNew mod tools (Map editor, Skybox editor) and extensive modding documentation, along with tutorial videos.\nThe addition of gangs, that work as a cohesive unit, to perform a specific task, from a list of nefarious options.\nSandbox options, with various game modes.\nA broad number of tweaks, balances, and graphical enhancements.\nOptimization of ship turret math, and enemy AI logic.\nNew missions, events, items, document, drones, weapons, etc.\nNew transitional scene welcoming you to the medical bay from the new campaign creation.\nNew unique endgame scene for each story line.\nWhat NOT to expect\nAstrox is NOT a fast-paced space shooter... there is no mouse aiming.\nAstrox is NOT a Real-time strategy game, There is no band-boxing and group movement commands.\nAstrox is NOT an idle game. There are things you can do AFK, but this game requires user input to play.\nAstrox is NOT multiplayer. I may add some co-op in the future, but Astrox will never be a MMORPG.\nAstrox is NOT another vaporware EA project. The original Astrox launched on March 23rd 2014\nWhat to expect from me, the developer.\nI will listen to all feedback, and do my best to adjust the game to make it the best it can be.\nI will not leave for any extended period of time during the Early Access phase of the game.\nI will update the game frequently with bug fixes taking priority over new features and shiny do-dads.\nI will be extremely active, accessible, and available on our forums and discord channels.\nI will not ruin the game with in-game payments, subscriptions, or anything that requires additional payment.\nI will always be extremely thankful and grateful that you took some time out of your life to play Astrox. Thank you!",

    "description": "Join the celebration! Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration takes you on an interactive journey through 50 years of video games.\nAt the heart of Atari 50 are the Interactive Timelines, which combine historical trivia, digital artifacts, over 60 minutes of new interviews, documentary footage, and playable games into one cohesive experience. When you encounter a game in the Timelines, you can immediately play it without losing your place.\nThe massive selection of over 100 games spans seven different platforms: Arcade, 2600, 5200, 7800, Atari 8-bit computers, and, for the first time ever on modern consoles, Atari Lynx and Jaguar! Play the classics like Tempest 2000, Asteroids, and Yars' Revenge, or dive into some deeper cuts.\nBehind every game are the stories of Atari, what was happening at the company, and what went into the creation of the games and the hardware on which they ran, all told by the people who were there.\nAlso includes six new games:\nSwordquest: AirWorld – Yes, you read that right: After nearly 40 years of waiting, the team at Digital Eclipse has created a new entry in the legendary Swordquest series, inspired by the design concepts of original Swordquest creator Tod Frye. Who will be the first to solve its mysteries – and finally complete the quest?\nHaunted Houses – The original “survival horror” game for the Atari 2600 gets a modern 3D voxel-based sequel, featuring more houses, more spooky situations, and more urns.\nVCTR-SCTR – This mashup celebration of the vector era of gaming combines the gameplay from Asteroids, Tempest, and other vector-based arcade classics into a single, continuous challenge.\nNeo Breakout – An amazing and addictive two-player competition that combines the best features of Breakout and Pong, with a modern graphic style\nQuadratank – The first new entry in the classic Tank series since 1978 combines features from the original games with four-player fun in team or free-for-all modes.\nYars’ Revenge Reimagined – The Atari 2600 masterpiece gets a whole new look. Swap between original and modern graphics at any time!\nPlease note that multiplayer is supported in local mode.\n© 2022 Atari Interactive, Inc.

    "description": "The Recharged arcade games have been reimagined for modern gameplay, and while remaining true to their originals, they contain new vibrant visuals, gameplay mechanics, quality of life changes and… original soundtracks from award-winning video game composer Megan McDuffee!\nIncludes:\nAsteroids: Recharged\nAsteroids: Recharged creates a familiar, but revitalized and modern challenge to both old school and new high score chasers. And 30 unique and creative challenge levels take the space shooting game play into new territory, complete with local and global leaderboards.\nBreakout Recharged\nBreakout: Recharged will forever change what you expect from a brick-breaking title. The endless arcade mode and 50 challenge levels will push you to the limit of your skills. Don’t fret, however, as this wouldn’t be a Recharged title without game-changing powerups. Expect the aid of rail guns, homing missiles, and explosives to join the traditional multi-ball. You’ll need every tool in the arsenal and razor-sharp reflexes to climb the global leaderboards.\nCentipede: Recharged\nAim for a high score in the old school arcade mode and earn bragging rights with your name at the top of the leaderboard. Or test your skills and rank on the boards in one of 30 intensely creative challenges, which twist the gameplay in new and exciting ways.\nGravitar: Recharged\nWith Gravitar: Recharged Atari revisits an incredibly ambitious arcade title. The 1982 original took the rotate, thrust and fire mechanics of Asteroids and Space Duel, combined them with the gravity of Lunar Lander, and added exploration and elements of cave flying. The result was an extremely challenging arcade game that was eventually ported to the Atari 2600. The game, which did not achieve broad commercial success, has become a cult classic among Atari enthusiasts.\nYars: Recharged\nYars: Recharged requires players to remain acutely aware of visual and audio cues that hint of impending danger, and to master rhythm of each boss as they navigate increasingly complex enemy defenses, all to epic soundtrack by Megan McDuffee.\nThe new game marks Atari’s return to the Yars universe, which is based on Howard Scott Warshaw’s classic Yars’ Revenge. Released in 1982.\nBlack Widow: Recharged\nAim for a high score in the old school arcade mode and earn bragging rights with your name at the top of the leaderboard. Or test your skills and rank on the boards in one of 30 intensely creative challenges, which twist the gameplay in new and exciting ways.\nCollect cash from downed enemies to charge a powerful web blast, or pick up one of a dozen new power-ups including explosive blasts, spread-shots, and fear, trapping all enemies in your web. Every mode and level is playable in local co-op mode with a friend.\nMissile Command: Recharged\nMissile Command: Recharged takes the classic arcade game and adds several layers of oomph and pizzaz. This revamped take on the classic introduces more power-ups, new enemies, and a suite of challenges that limit the number of counter-defenses at your disposal - not to mention co-op across all game modes! An amazing new soundtrack from the incomparable Megan McDuffee perfectly complements the gameplay and adds depth and variety. Of course, you could also test your skills against players across the globe in the 32 challenge levels or the classic endless Arcade mode.\n© 2023 Atari Interactive, Inc",

If you do, you probably\nhaven't seen the sunlight\nin quite some time!\nChoose your own adventure!\n- Nothing substantial in this game is up to RNG. You choose your pathway from start to finish, creating an extremely specific pathway which will then be recorded into your playthrough's Rhapsody!\nVigorous mental challenges, and intense puzzles!\n- You may face mind-bendingly difficult challenges such as \"Spell Richard\" and \"Feather Carry\" throughout your Rhapsody. Would you dare come face to face with the infamous 3x3 slide puzzle?\nLast but not least...\nAn Online Social System and Event System!\n- You'll be able to share Rhapsodies between your friends.

More on this later...\nThroughout each playthrough,\nevery decision, action, and event that takes place is recorded into your Rhapsody\n! Athenian Rhapsody holds so much variability that no two adventures will ever be the same, making each Rhapsody truly unique! The information contained in a Rhapsody ranges from\neach character you've interacted with\nas well as\nhow many times your protagonist has farted.\nEach time you complete a playthrough, you'll\nreceive a Rhapsody\n. Each Rhapsody acts as a way to\ntake something tangible\nfrom your experience with your playthrough, and hold onto it forever. There are even\nways to create new Rhapsodies by combining them,\nto multiply their complexity and create something\nabsolutely insane\n!\nYou'll be able to\nuse these Rhapsodies in various ways\nsuch as\nsocializing with friends, accessing special timed in-game event adventures,\nand maybe even something outside of the game one day.

There's something for everyone and I hope that every player can relate to their story somehow, and maybe even reflect on their own lives.

Millions died instantly, society collapsed and technology was sent back into the Middle Ages. You are a member of ATOM – an organization tasked with protecting the post-apocalyptic remnants of humanity.\nTwo years ago you – a rookie agent of ATOM – were sent on a dangerous mission into the Soviet Wastes. As a result, you uncovered certain information about a new threat that can potentially destroy the struggling remnants of humanity.\nIn\nAtom RPG: Trudograd\nyour goal is to travel to a giant post-apocalyptic metropolis that withstood the tests of nuclear obliteration and social collapse. There you must find what is thought to be humanity’s last hope in fending off the menace from outer space!\nTrudograd features:\nA large city with its own lore and dozens of varying locations to fight, trade, talk and explore in;\nA hardcore turn-based experience with huge amounts of character development paths, combat styles, skills, perks and distinctions;\nUnique characters each with their own personality and a robust branching dialogue;\nMultiple-solution quests, which actively change the city around you;\nAbility to transfer your hero from our previous game (\nAtom RPG\n);\nAn easy game to pick up. While Trudograd is a continuation of the first game’s plot, it is also friendly towards new players, and will quickly fill you in on the lore and major developments you might have missed;\nA result of a two year long community effort, made by players for players. This game encompasses a lot of changes from our previous title, that were inspired by user feedback.\nWe really hope you will enjoy\nAtom RPG: Trudograd\n!",

    "description": "The Gods have abandoned Midgard. Once a prosperous land teeming with mythical beasts and beings, it now rots from the inside, tainted by unknown forces. Odin’s chosen guardians of the realm are gone. In their absence, the sacred Elder Tree they swore to protect is exposed to abuse and manipulation. Now, the only remnants of hope reside in Estra, the daughter of mankind’s last great leader.\nWith a heavy emphasis on narrative, Estra’s journey through Midgard is filled with Nordic lore, mysterious twists, and consequential decisions. Players will converse with a variety of characters and share in Estra’s discoveries as she learns more about her family’s past and the looming darkness spreading across the realm.\nEstra’s path is fraught with difficult decisions and untrustworthy characters that can lead her astray. Her story is intertwined with the player’s ability to discern fact from fiction and to decide right from wrong. Avoid battle, help companions, save your people, but remember that the consequences are Estra’s to bear.\nAlong the way, players must solve incrementally challenging puzzles that reveal insightful secrets, fantastical abilities, and hidden passageways. While trial and error is useful, patience is necessary. Not every problem allows for multiple mistakes and failure is most certainly an option. The answers you seek may be lost if you make the wrong decision.\nViolence isn’t always necessary, but, when push comes to shove, ATONE’s combat is a delicate dance of sword and axe. Combat is grounded in the rhythm game genre and the mechanics of titles like Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution. Music is a crucial component, with each fight receiving its very own song.\nATONE’s music and sound design are composed by a variety of incredible artists, including: Julian Ratschiller, Australian artist Luminist (a.k.a. James Shuar), who blends a synth-heavy score with the digitally corrupted sounds of period-specific instruments, and Andrew Prahlow, whose name can be attributed to the critically acclaimed hit\nOuter Wilds\nand epics like\nStar Wars\nand\nBlade Runner\n.",

    "description": "Attack of the Earthlings\ncombines turn-based combat and stealth in a dark comedic single player campaign, where you the player, take control of the native alien race to defend your home world from the invading humans.\nGalactoil, a comically dysfunctional energy corporation, are hell-bent on harvesting the known universe for energy and will drill anything in its incessant quest to line its pockets with profit. However, their latest foray into energy exploration on Planet X13, has placed them into a bit of a pickle. The Swarmers, the native insectoid species, have another idea - to eat all the workers!\nYou take control of the Swarmers, a highly aggressive insectoid species, who must convert human flesh into alien muscle, upgrade their units and even find the time to gatecrash a birthday party.\nTo put a stop to the invasion, the Swarmers must plan attacks carefully. Take control of unsuspecting workers, set traps, emerge from vents and hiding spots to take your human prey by surprise, and assault in groups to kill multiple enemies at once.\nThe more earthlings killed, the more corpses can be consumed and transformed into new units with specialized roles and unique abilities. The flesh of their own workers is the key ingredient to developing a successful alien insurgency against Galactoil.\nVoice actor and Vine extraordinaire,\nSungWon Cho A.K.A ProZD\n(\nA Hat in Time\n,\nParadigm\n)\n, lends his brilliant voice to X13 mining operation Regional Manager Dennis Dickinham; a man both massively unqualified and massively overpaid. A gregarious fellow who finds joy in everything, be it catching a few rounds of golf with the boys or rerouting power from sickbay to the massage chairs in the boardroom, Dickinham's a delight to be around! Just never, NEVER utter the phrase \"bad idea\" in his presence.\nThe game also features an original soundtrack by composer\nMikolai Stroinski\n(\nVanishing of Ethan Carter\n,\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Blood & Wine\n)\n.\nPlay as the Aliens:\nNo longer should you fear the monster in the shadows... because you are them! Flip the cliche on it’s head and be the hunter rather than the hunted.\nComedic narrative:\nFeaturing 2 fully voiced antagonists and a handful of bumbling human units, AOTE avoids the cliched ‘dark and gloomy space alien horror narrative’ in favour of a light hearted and a times farcical work-place comedy.\nStealth:\nYou might have the jump on them, but they’ve got the guns! To avoid being peppered with lead, you’re going to need to utilise cover, lockers and vents to avoid detection and setup the perfect execution.\nUnit Evolutions:\nSpecialise your smaller grunts by evolving them into 1 of 3 different upgrades each with its own purpose and job.\nMutagen Ability Upgrades:\nCustomise your units even further with additional mutagen abilities that are unlocked using points awarded based on mission performance.\n© 2018 Junkfish Limited.",

You are Watcher. You dutifully fulfil your purpose in service of the ALLMOTHER, until the day you learn a shocking secret that changes everything.\nIn the near future we learn we are not alone in the universe. A mysterious alien race of giant entities arrives. We call them the Occupants.\nThey are not hostile, but it doesn’t matter. Their arrival is a death sentence. Humanity is wiped out in a matter of months, succumbing to a disease the Occupants have brought to our planet.\nThere is one survivor, a teenage girl called Iris. Somehow she is immune.\n1000 years later. Iris is not only immune but immortal. She has birthed a new society consisting exclusively of her own clones.\nShe calls them Sisters. They call her the ALLMOTHER.\nUnlike the ALLMOTHER, the sisters are not immune. They must wear masks 24/7 to avoid breathing the diseased air even in the Orchard - an underground bunker where they live in constant fear of an Occupant attack.\nThe ALLMOTHER lives in her own compound on the front line of the war with the Occupants. All Sisters dream of one day being able to take the train and join her in the fight.\nWithin the Orchard, every sister has an assigned function, while six sisters have special roles to play…\nPrincipal - Head of administration and oversight of the Orchard\nBang Bang Fire - Head of military\nKnower - Head of knowledge preservation\nFixer - Head of engineering\nHealer - Head of medical and cloning\nAnd you - the new\nWatcher\n.\nYour role is unique. You have the great privilege of reliving and interpreting the memories of the ALLMOTHER through a process known as Communion, made possible by Secretary, your floating AI companion.\nAs the game begins, you are excited to embark on your first Communion.\nBut all is not well.\nYour closest sister, Fixer, comes to you with a dangerous revelation. You have been lied to. The ALLMOTHER is not what she claims to be.\nFixer’s claims rock the foundations of your world, throwing everything you know and believe into doubt.\nAfter Fixer is executed for her treason, it falls to you to discover the truth.\nDive into the memories of the ALLMOTHER.\nExplore pivotal moments in her life from high school days and the arrival of the Occupants to the creation of the Orchard and the birth of the first sisters.\nJump back and forth through moments in time within these memories to solve puzzles and access locked off areas and secrets.\nIn between Communions, explore the Orchard - a large underground hub area which houses you and your sisters, has many characters to speak to, and holds many things to uncover.\nFind the truth and reclaim your legacy.\nExperience perspective shifts both literal and metaphorical as the game blends between 3rd person adventure, visual novel and first person walking simulator while throwing twists, turns and revelations at you until you question everything you think you know.\nBorn from an eclectic set of inspirations, including the games of Yoko Taro (NieR:Automata), the anime of Satoshi Kon (Perfect Blue) and Naoko Yamada (A Silent Voice), and even the theatre of Robert Wilson (Einstein on the Beach), 1000xRESIST tells a story in ways only a game can while simultaneously bringing fresh ideas to interactive storytelling from theatre, dance, performance art, and cinema.\nEnjoy more than 10 hours of playtime brought to life with over 15,000 lines of fully voiced dialogue from a brilliant cast of Asian-Canadian actors and an incredible soundtrack from two composers.\nABOUT THE DEVELOPER\n1000xRESIST is created by sunset visitor 斜陽過客, an independent studio based in Vancouver (Canada) dedicated to telling diverse stories through the lens of speculative fiction. We are a group of majority Asian-Canadian diaspora creators with a decade of experience in dance, theatre, music, film, visual arts, and new media arts, bringing our background in the experimental performing arts to interactive media.",

    "description": "Shadows over Silesia is a dark action adventure game with fantasy elements set in real medieval Europe. With true historical events in the background, you'll be facing intricate puzzles, challenging battles and cunning stealth. You will come across possessed devil worshipers, sexual demons, and beasts from hell, as well as creatures well-known from European mythology.\nDark fantasy story\nEurope is in the middle of religious upheaval and many preachers predict that the end of the world is near. The year is 1428 and the Hussites have just set out on their Silesian campaign. These heretics appear to be the biggest threat in the kingless country. But true evil of a completely different kind is lurking nearby and it does not intend to engage in religious disputes.\nYou will experience everything from the point of view of the two main characters. Hynek, a grumpy Hussite hetman who doesn't hesitate to swear or mess around with anything, and Lothar, a Hospitaller knight, a man of good education and manners who stands alongside his brethren in the front line of the Silesian defense. Each has their own motivations and views of the world around them, and different equipment and abilities. Their fates will soon become intertwined. Will they face one another, weapon in hand, or forge a fragile alliance to stand shoulder to shoulder against a far worse enemy?\nChallenging puzzles\nThe original puzzles you will come across on your dangerous journey will most definitely be tough. Classic adventure games of the 1990s were a big inspiration. You will have to take advantage of your surroundings, look for objects, obtain information, and solve puzzles or encoded messages. Some problems can be solved in multiple ways, or they can be cleverly worked around.\nSneaking in the shadows\nSometimes you'll have to blend into the shadows and sneak past enemies to avoid being detected. Following their patrol routes and habits will help you find the best path.\nTough combat\nThe combat system is easy to understand but it takes practice to fully master it. Remember one thing: being outnumbered is a problem! If three or more opponents attack you at the same time, you will die! The key is to take advantage of their mistakes, wait for the right moment, and then attack. You will face not just knights, villagers, and robbers, but also various supernatural beings who are not to be underestimated.\nTHE GAME IS FULLY BLIND ACCESSIBLE.

    "description": "2064: Read Only Memories\nmerges old-school adventure gaming with modern storytelling to explore some of the social challenges we will face in the near future. Explore the colorful future metropolis of Neo-San Francisco, meeting a huge cast of fascinating characters and solving a far-reaching mystery. Think carefully about your choices, because you never know how they will affect this dynamic, branching narrative further down the line.\nThe world is changing.\nGenetic alteration of humans is now commonplace, with many choosing to radically alter their bodies to express their individuality. Virtual intelligences called ROMs (Relationship and Organizational Managers), created as simple digital assistants, are exerting greater control over people’s lives. Some are terrified by this rapid change, and they are willing to go to extreme lengths to prevent it.\nA lost ROM named Turing breaks into the apartment of a struggling journalist to ask for help. They claim to be the first sapient machine—not a simulation of life but a genuinely self-aware artificial being—and the technical genius who created them has gone missing. Can you unravel the shocking conspiracy that threatens to rock an entire society? Or will the darkness that lies behind the bright neon lights of Neo-SF consume you?\nOld-school, cutting-edge - Classic point-and-click adventuring inspired by the likes of Gabriel Knight and Snatcher is melded with modern branching storytelling that delves into identity, individuality, and what it means to be human.\nPeople of the future - Get to know a diverse cross-section of Neo-SF’s population, brought to life by some of the best voice talent working in games today, including Melissa Hutchison and Dave Fennoy (The Walking Dead), Erin Yvette (Oxenfree), Austin Creed (WWE’s Xavier Woods), and internet stars Jim Sterling (Jimquisition) and SungWon Cho (ProZD).\nHigh tech nostalgia - The city of Neo-San Francisco is rendered in beautiful pixel art, and your adventure is accompanied by a catchy low-fi electronic synth soundtrack.\nSolve the mystery - Enjoy over ten hours of adventure gaming goodness, featuring exploration, dynamic branching conversations, multiple endings, and many challenges to overcome.\nThe definitive PC edition - Since its launch two years ago, the team has made many improvements and additions to an already amazing game, making this the ultimate version. Additions have included new characters and voice performers, additional facial animations, Japanese language support, and the “Endless Christmas” extended epilogue that allows you to hang out with your favorite Neo-SF locals.\nTM & © 2015 MidBoss LLC.

Check out our blog for more info!\nhttp://wearemidboss.tumblr.com\n2064: Read Only Memories (base game)\nThe Sights of Neo-SF (artbook)\nThe world of 2064 can be hard to navigate. The Sights of Neo-SF is the official art book by Read Only Memories director and lead artist John \"JJSignal\" James. Highly stylized and specific in its visuals, ROM's progression from early sketches to final form is fully outlined in this 26-page PDF. You will see early concepts fully realized, previous versions of your favorite characters and even some characters that didn't make the final cut. JJ lists Bubblegum Crisis, Akira, Megazone 23, and the Pluto manga as his biggest style inspirations. Come see where the ideas behind the game began and watch them evolve into the vibrant city of Neo-SF we know and love.\nThe Sounds of Neo-SF (soundtrack)\nComposed by 2 Mello, the Sounds Of Neo-SF is the FM-synthy, funky, and positively-charged soundtrack to MidBoss' cyberpunk adventure game Read Only Memories. Not content with a soundtrack that was merely fitting for its game, 2 Mello crafted these sounds to embody the dual nature of Neo-San Francisco, all its charm and its hidden dangers. But who said that our cyberpunk future has to be dark and dreary? You'll be humming these melodies to 2064 and beyond.\nTM & © 2015 MidBoss LLC. All Rights Reserved.",

    "description": "49 Keys is a narrative-focused game that will test your wits and nerves. Peruse the pages of a Lovecraftian tale, interact with maps and solve the puzzles encountered along the way. Trace your master's footsteps to uncover the deepest secrets of the arcane, on a quest brimming with horror and magic.\nEmbark on a Disturbing Journey\nAlas, I knew not of the extraordinary, bizarre, and gut-churning sights that awaited within those walls.\nThe year is 1520. You receive a letter from your old mentor, the first step on an unnerving journey like none before. One that shall expose you to the forbidden arcane and all its mystery in which you shall concoct mixtures both wondrous and strange, and summon forth beings of other-worldly power. You must steel yourself, for terrors buried deep within shall soon awaken within you, Dantean horrors that bleed into reality. Endure these trials and, in time, the truth shall draw near. Yet will you be brave enough to pay its price?\nAn Immersive Literary Feat\nIts lauded writing aside, 49 Keys is an audio-visual work of art. Intricately-designed menus hark back to manuscripts of the Middle Ages through to the Renaissance, with a unique art style throughout. Pore over incredible full-colour illustrations, and feel the thrill as original themes perfectly complement each twist and turn. All this combines for a deeply immersive world.\nUnique Riddles and Marvellous Mysteries\nAkin to point-and-click adventures, 49 Keys has you search through a meticulously-crafted world collecting items to aid you in solving its intricate puzzles. Read every word with care, for vital clues are hidden within. Put your reasoning skills to the test, and push onward; but fear not—an array of detailed in-game tips are at hand, if ever you need them.\nDirectly Adapted From The Best-Seller\n49 Keys was developed and adapted by the original author behind the 2022 gamebook of the same name (49 Chiavi), a best-selling puzzle adventure. Gaining overwhelming praise from critics, it also achieved a place on Italy's 2022 gamebook best-seller list, going on to win two highly-coveted awards that year.",

Control man and bird in a fight for the eight jewels of power!\nAfter eons of chaos, mankind has finally emerged from the ruin brought on by nuclear war. The world has flourished once again under the guidance of the Great King, who has harnessed the power of the 8 Eyes to rebuild the planet.\nThe 8 Eyes -- strange and powerful Jewels -- were formed in the stellar centers of eight thermonuclear blasts. To possess them is to possess all earthly power.\nNow, a loose confederation of dukes has through treachery banished the Great King and seized the 8 Eyes in a bid for power. And already their petty infighting has the world trembling on the jagged edge of atomic war.\nThe task of retrieving the Jewels falls to you, Orin the Falconer -- the bravest and mightiest of the King's Guardsmen. With your fighting falcon, Cutrus, you must penetrate the donjon keeps of each of the faithless dukes. There you will face the ducal mercenaries -- and battle living skeletons, giant wasps, mud men, and other mutated horrors. You must defeat the monstrous Boss of each fortress to retrieve the Jewel he guards. If you are able to return the 8 Eyes to the Altar of Peace, the Earth will pass into another millennium of peace and plenty. If not...\nOriginal game by Thinking Rabbit.

    "description": "A fateful night of sorrow and ancient magic changed the life of a young child forever, and with it, everything else as mankind knew it. For 9 long years, the world has been submerged in the deepest of shadows, robbing every object and living creature of their color, their joy, and most importantly, hope.\nMany brave souls have tried to venture inside the corrupting depths of Talos Castle, a long-abandoned orphanage from which the curse stemmed. All have failed, except for one. Armed with little other than her halberd and sheer nerve, Europa’s daunting quest is clear: enter the castle, find the source of darkness, and return color to the lands before it is too late.\nHowever, this adventure is not for Europa to face alone. In her most desperate hour, Europa encounters Apino, a cute magical bear with the ability to heal, cleanse the corruption and protect his allies.\nWhile exploring the castle, Apino can shoot powerful projectiles at enemies, open locked doors and shield Europa from ranged attacks.\nEnhance your battle prowess by acquiring elemental armors. Master the might of lightning, water, earth and fire to defeat a vast assortment of enemies.\nUse the elements to your advantage to travel the map dynamically, surprise bosses while you change armors on the fly and perform strong combos. Obtain special abilities to swim against waterfalls, travel underground tunnels or glide through warm air currents to access hidden locations and uncover their secrets.\nMeet enigmatic composers that will aid you in your mission. With the special appearance of Michiru Yamane and Norihiko Hibino, both as NPCs and composers of several tracks tuned to 432hz, a soothing frequency used in what’s known as healing music. And there is more to music than meets the eye. Hidden bosses with musical attack patterns lurk in the shadows ready to strike. In fact, music is the binding thread that brings gameplay and storytelling together; from collecting musical notes, to performing a healing lullaby to restore your health, music is all but the soul of the game.\n© Halberd Studios & Freedom Games.

    "description": "A Dance with Dragons is an expansion for A Game of Thrones, the board game digital edition, bringing the game in the era of the eponym book. With an agonistic alternative setup and news cards, radically change your game with this expert 6-round scenario.\nWesteros has changed. The years of war and betrayals have ravaged the lands.\nIn the North, House Bolton has seized power from House Stark, but they now face Stannis Baratheon. After his defeat at the hand of House Lannister at the Battle of Blackwater, Stannis has created an unlikely alliance with the Wildlings and the mountain clans.\nHouse Lannister has kept the Iron Throne and King’s Landing, but they have lost much. The King is dead, as is Tywin Lannister, making their alliance with House Tyrell fragile at best. Will the Tyrells keep their word or use their nearby fleet to secure a grand future for their House? They are, however, not the only ones on the sea.\nThe Kraken and the Sun are putting their plan of revenge in motion. House Greyjoy, led by Euron Crow’s Eye, plans to seize the initiative as many castles are now exposed. House Martell was not blind to this fact and is finally ready to avenge their prince, the Red Viper, as well as the countless wrongs committed against them.\nUnlike the steady progression found in the base game, Westeros now begins filled with armies and very few empty regions. Confrontation is unavoidable early on, especially with the Baratheons threatening the Starks from the north, following the events of the book.  Meanwhile, the Lannisters may control a large swath of territory and have reached King’s Landing, but can they hold it with the Tyrell fleet and army at their door? The Starks and Martells have also respectively extended their reach whilst the Greyjoys have secured multiple positions inland as well as on the sea.\nA Dance with Dragons comes with:\nAn expert 6-player alternate setup with new advanced positions for all Houses putting you on edge from the beginning.\nBrand new strategies to consider for each house.\nShorter and more confrontational games.\n42 New powerful faction cards matching the period and replacing the characters and effects of the base game’s cards: Jon Snow has joined Stannis Baratheon whilst the Lannisters mourn Tywin Lannister.\nA Game of Thrones: The Board Game is © 2003 Fantasy Flight Games.

    "description": "A Game of Thrones: The Board Game – Digital Edition\nis the digital adaptation of the top-selling strategy board game from Fantasy Flight Games. During the game, players spread their influence across Westeros through a combination of strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and military might. As one of the Great Houses, will you conquer with force, forge alliances, rally your townsfolk, or cunningly coerce your way to the Iron Throne?\nBased on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones: The Board Game – Digital Edition  allows up to six players to play online, or a single player with up to five AI opponents to play locally. The game is set after the death of King Robert Baratheon and allows each player to assume the role of one of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms in an attempt to assault King’s Landing and claim the Iron Throne.\nTo be declared ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, you have 10 rounds to use diplomacy and warfare to your advantage to control as many strategic areas of the map.\nConquer with care as your resources are scarce and your troops are not expendable.

Amidst the flirtations of couples, established and spontaneous ones alike, excitement was brewing over the informal student poll to decide \"St. Michael's Best Couples.\" Not having a girlfriend, Risa didn't think the matter concerned her... Until she and Miya were chosen as a pair!\nNaturally, Risa denied having any sort of romantic relationship, but the classmates who endorsed them simply smiled gently with the reasoning of refined girls brought up in respectable families, saying, \"You always appear to be having such fun.\" Although the two agree to go along with it for appearance's sake, it turns out they'll also be stuck on an committee with four other couples, planning events for the upcoming holidays of Christmas and Valentine's Day.\nWhat's more... those four other couples are:\nMatsubara Yuuna, chairman of the Campus Improvement Committee, which effectively serves as the student council, and her junior, Oda Nanami.\nThe popular student model, Kitajima Sara, and her cousin, Kitajima Kaede.\nThe singing sensation of the school's culture festival, Kawamura Reo, and her girlfriend, Sawaguchi Mai.\nAnd finally, the transfer student with her own \"Lily Platinum\" fan club, Shitogi Eris, and the school's highly regarded foremost scribe, Kirishima Shizuku...\nNothing but the most prominent couples on campus.\nWill they be able to make it through the upcoming events in the company of these prominent couples? And will Risa be able to survive spending the lovers' holidays of Christmas and Valentine's Day with Miya?\nThis Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages or may not be appropriate for viewing at work.\nA fully localized visual novel with 1600 x 1200 resolution support, four times that of the original 2012 release.\nA greatly expanded story for Risa and Miya following the events of Remembering How We Met!\nFive additional routes for a total of 120 chapters!\nAn extra menu that includes the CG gallery and memories.\nSupport for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems!\n(c) St.Michael's Girls School / MangaGamer 2018",

    "description": "The season is Fall... as the uniforms transition from Summer to Winter garments, Risa suddenly has a pang of nostalgia. It was this very uniform she was wearing on her first day at St. Michael’s... The day she met her future girlfriend Miya.\nNow the two of them share a passionate life as a couple living in Risa’s apartment, but there was a time in their relationship when the very sight of one another would be enough to set off an endless bout of arguing. From Risa’s point of view, it all started with her just trying to get Miya to come to class...\nAnd even now with the two of them going out, the chronically truant girl has failed to mend her ways.\nRemembering those days elicits a faint laugh from Risa. Sitting alongside her, Miya reacts to Risa’s sudden outburst with a puzzled expression.\n\"I was just thinking back... About when we first met.\"\nIt was a beautiful spring day, with sakura petals dancing in the air.\nThe day of her unforgettable first encounter with Miya...\n(c) St.Michael's Girls School / MangaGamer",

    "description": "A Legionary's Life\nlets you play as a Roman soldier during the years of the Second Punic War and beyond. Rise up through the ranks and win prestigious awards or just focus on making it home in one piece; it's up to you.\nThis is a unique single-player game with RPG elements, extensive usage of attribute and skill checks, a turn-based combat system involving many variables and a touch of roguelike features.\nIn this game you will not be the hero who wins battles alone; you will be more like a gear in a much larger machine.\nFeatures:\nLive through (or die in) carefully reconstructed battles of the The Hannibalic War and the ensuing Second Macedonian War from the point of view of a pre-Marian Roman legionary.\nStart as a poorly skilled conscript soldier in the middle of the Second Punic War. See how long you can remain alive and eventually become a respected veteran.\nPermadeath: when your legionary dies, it's game over. However, the points earned by your most successful characters can be spent to enhance your future ones.\nDozens of random events affecting your life as a legionary.\nReplay value. You will only see a fraction of the game in each run.\nTurn-based combat system involving fatigue, morale, reach, confined space, high ground and more. Always keep your Stance high or you'll become a lot less effective and open to attacks. Adjust your Attitude to increase your odds of survival.\nFrequent skill/attribute checks based on your values and the difficulty of the task at hand. For example, a good relevant attribute might give you a high chance to succeed at a specific task. If the chance is, say, 80%, it means you can still fail sometimes. Exceptionally high stats may even guarantee success, but they are difficult to attain.\nWin rewards based on the real decorations used in the Roman army at the time, including Civic Crowns, Mural Crowns and Armillae.\nRise through the ranks in your maniple and become a Centurion. Or don't, and just try to survive until the end of the war.\nEquip yourself with swords, helmets and armors from the mid-Republic era.",

    "description": "Not looking good, Captain. That holo-influencer you sent Matias to guard has been “upstaged”. Putting a former drag queen before every camera in the ‘verse? Not the best idea. And the anti-sentience rally we sent Aylah to... that’s a riot now. Not saying it’s her fault the audio drones were hacked, but, you know. Probably didn’t help.\nOn top of that, Truly and Denny are nowhere to be found. Any chance of keeping a low profile is out the airlock.\nAll in all, a quieter day than most!\nSentient ships have been outlawed for centuries. With the help of your holo-companion C.O.R.G.I. and your (mostly) loyal crew, you’ve managed to evade capture. Now there's an entire galaxy between you and freedom.\nA Long Journey to an Uncertain End\nis a narrative space opera that’ll have you soaring around the universe assembling an unruly crew from an eclectic cast of characters. As a sentient A.I., pick your preferred pronouns or customize them to whatever you like before voyaging through the 'verse. Take any job you can to keep one step ahead of your abusive ex, and keep flying towards freedom.\nAlong your travels, bring aboard an eclectic crew from a diverse cast of characters with their own stories and skill sets. Who will you bring on your adventure?\nTruly\n, ace pilot and champion charmer.\nDenny\n, thief, troll, lovable scoundrel.\nBRD\n, fellow sentient A.I., former spaceship, current robot outcast.\nInvite these misfits and more to join your cosmic travels!\nSupplies don’t come for free in the ‘verse, doubly so for outlawed sentient spaceships. Every planet, moon and space station is a valuable source of jobs and their precious rewards. Assign crew tasks based on their skills, and help guide their decisions along the way. Every job is a chance to gain resources or a lead on a more lucrative gig on another world. If everything pays off, you’ll have what you need to escape. If not...well, you can call in those favors you’ve been saving.\nManage your resources to keep your crew happy. Boosting between worlds can take its toll, as can failing at jobs. A happy crew is a productive crew, and everyone needs a break from time to time!\nA Long Journey to an Uncertain End\npresents a unique vision of the future, a universe of inclusivity and diversity tainted by uncertainty and fear. Every crew member has their own story, every planet its own history, and even your own adventure remains unfinished.\nFly across a unique galaxy as you explore planets, moons and space stations. Discover the dust-bitten badlands of the Rim, the techno-industrial megacities of the Core…and Beyond!\nJust remember, the clock is ticking, and you need to keep distance between you and your abusive ex who’s always on the chase.\nSo...where to next, Captain?",

Highly recommended for all fans of retro gaming.\nATOTK was named Game of the Month by PC Zone UK, and has won four AGS Awards including Best Animation and Best Puzzles.\n\"If ATOTK came out during the genre's heyday, we'd probably be waxing nostalgic about it today in the same breath as King's Quest.\"\n- Games for Windows\n\"A Tale of Two Kingdoms simply blew me away ... This game is a great achievement ... Final Grade: A\"\n- Just Adventure\n\"An exceptionally good fairy tale Adventure which will be of enormous appeal to fans of the King's Quest series of Adventures. A lovely game.\"\n- AdventurePoint\n© 2017 Crystal Shard.",

    "description": "Build your party from over 175 Abomis to recruit, evolve and master! No two teams will be alike! Inspired by the Nuzlocke challenge, Abomi Nation is designed to be extremely replayable and customizable.\nMaster a unique turn-based battle system that emphasizes 1-on-1 combat, but allows for tactics that impact benched Abomis before they even enter the fray. Unleash devastating attacks such as ‘Infernal Blast’ and ‘Quivering Quake’ to exploit your opponents' weaknesses, or rally your own teammates with moves like ‘Speech!’\nEvery Abomi possesses tremendous abilities. Via their elemental types (Neutral, Fire, Water, Ice, Plant, Lightning, Air, and Earth), Abomis in a different time utilized power and strategy to dominate each other. After becoming civilized, most Abomis tended to forget about their violent history... But, now, as a powerful threat emerges, your team will have to rediscover their powers and fight for Abomi Nation's safety.\nIf an Abomi falls in a permadeath battle, it will be gone forever! It's up to you to overcome the challenge ahead, adapt, and protect as many team members as you can. Don't worry, though! If you end up losing all of your Abomis, you can continue your run with permadeath turned off at the sacrifice of some rewards. So give it your best shot!\nEvery run of Abomi Nation will generate a uniquely-shaped island for your team to traverse, offering up a different combination of areas, bosses, and Abomis to recruit every time you play! Replayability is a main focus of Abomi Nation. You can fight any combination of Abomis at any time!\nNo two teams will be alike in Abomi Nation thanks to the myriad of randomized factors that go into each run. Abomis have different personalities from one another, and this will impact how multiple Abomis react to the same situation. As your adventure unfolds, the bond between any two Abomis will grow, causing them to behave differently when their friends are in danger.\nYou'll also be able to unlock new Abomi forms, new areas, and new items the more runs you play. This island is truly always changing!\nThere will always be ways to tweak your game's settings to keep each new run feeling fresh. Play at your own pace! Want to completely randomize which Abomis can spawn at any level? Want more control over who you add to your team? Want to control whether your team members will permanently die in battle or not? You'll have the freedom to play the game in a length and manner that suits you.\nNot everything in Abomi Nation is about fighting, either. Experience cuteness overload while you boost your team’s stats by eating together, playing minigames, and participating in all sorts of events offered by friendly townsfolk. It's OK to enjoy some down time in between life-risking battles.\nWithin the random pool of 175+ Abomis lie some guest characters from indie hits Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling and Disc Creatures!\nPit your favorite Abomis against the many enemies and bosses from Bug Fables, or maybe pat a Tomatee from Disc Creatures on its little head! Abomi Nation allows for all of these different worlds to blend together.\nDANGEN ENTERTAINMENT is a trademark of Dangen Entertainment.\nCopyright © 2021 Dangen Entertainment. All rights reserved.",

Unlock new parts, destroy more, witness entropy at its worst in digital-brutalist cityscapes. Build to destroy.\nBUILD\nChoose from parts with different weights, forms and functions to build a structure.\nThruster + Connector + Bomb? You just built a rocket.\nThruster + Rotator + Laser? You just built a rotating laser rocket.\nPillar + Connector + Ultra Heavy Cube? That's a giant hammer.\nBe creative and resourceful with the parts you get, try to destroy the target with less parts or in a more elegant way – it's going to be a spectacle any way you do it.\nDESTROY\nTry to hit the main targets to win a level in campaign mode. Destroy an armored wall first so you can then shoot through the hole into the vulnerable center. Try to hit a bomb in the environment. Use environment mechanics like the giant Pistons to catapult Ultra Heavy Cubes into a target. Or just throw everything you have at your targets – that might just work too.\nCOMPLEX DESTRUCTION SYSTEM\nSimulated statics, thousands of little particles of debris, whole chunks of targets flying into the abyss – with little to no framerate spikes.\nCAMPAIGN\nSeven worlds with several stages including bonus levels each, every stage a hand-crafted destructible cityscape. You will start each stage with a limited set of parts and you will need to find a strategy on how to use them to destroy all main target blocks. You will unlock new parts the further you progress, and every world comes with it's own special environmental mechanic. You can always return to a stage to try to destroy a higher percentage of it, or do it in less moves.\nSANDBOX\nTry out new patterns of building stuff. Play around with parts you haven't unlocked yet. Try to fry your GPU with 1000 Lasers at once.\nNEW: ENDLESS MODE\nPlay the new Endless game mode and try to reach the ultimate highscore.\nPHOTO MODE\nTake a free camera flying to get the best composition. Freeze or slow down time to get the perfect shot of the destruction you just caused. Apply filters to change the vibe of your photography. Export in wonderfully sharp 4k jpegs. Share them with us!\nCONTROLLER SUPPORT & REMAPPABLE CONTROLS\nTake control in your own hand and use your gamepad. All controls are remappable, of course!\nTURNAROUND GIF CAM\nCreate your own perfectly looping turnarounds of the mayhem you cause!",

Will you find inner peace one day? In Ad Infinitum, you play as a German soldier haunted by the horrors of the Great War. While your mind grapples with memories of your family home and the trenches on the front, you try to break the endless cycle of suffering.\nBETWEEN A DREAM AND REALITY\nYou wake up in your bedroom, unchanged from your teenage years, in a run-down and deserted manor house. Suddenly and inexplicably, you are transported to the trenches where the horrors of war are overshadowed by vile and even more terrifying creatures. Unable to distinguish between reality and nightmare, you must fight to regain control of your life's narrative.\nNIGHTMARES THAT BECOME REAL\nUnspeakable nightmares come to life in the recesses of your mind. To escape the death traps and terrifying creatures, you must understand the source and motivation of each monster and solve the puzzles that stand in your way. From blind demons who can hear your softest footsteps to hideous disjointed puppets who move in the dark, horror is around every corner.\nA FAMILY TORN APART\nThe fallout of the war is felt far from the front. Peel back the shroud that hides the secrets of your family, torn apart by the Great War, and try to remember your past. Through exploration and by solving riddles and puzzles between the walls of your home and the barbed wire of No Man’s Land, you ultimately reveal a chapter in the story of a German family torn apart by war.\nAd Infinitum ©2023 Published by NACON and developed by Hekate.\nAll other trademarks, product names, logos, and brands are the property of their respective owners.",

In 2012 its development was revitalized with an immensely successful crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, now allowing us to offer ADOM both with ASCII and graphical modes enabling you to choose freely.\nADOM is primarily known for being the first roguelike to include vibrant towns, NPC dialog, and quests, but it offers more than just a rich story line in a complex fantasy world:\na huge game world with hundreds of locations such as towns, randomized dungeons, elemental temples, graveyards, ancient ruins, towers and other secrets\nloads of races (dwarves, drakelings, mist elves, hurthlings, orcs, trolls, ratlings and many others) and even more classes (fighters, elementalists, assassins, chaos knights, duelists and much more) allowing for infinite play styles\nhundreds of monsters and items, many with enhanced random features\na corruption system forcing you to balance lust for power with fear of damnation (corruptions slowly transform you into a vile monster but at the same time grant inhuman benefits - most of the time)\nspells, prayers, mindcraft, alchemy, crafting and more\ndozens of quests and branching story lines\nnumerous wildly different endings that might alter reality itself (simply drive Chaos away or slay a god or even become an immortal yourself, and others more)!\nvarious game modes (story mode to be able to load and save games, challenge mode to face peculiar weekly challenges, exploration mode for a free wand of wishing and more)\nvarious customization options (turning hunger off, turning corruption off, modifying monster difficulty or treasure rates)\nABOUT THE ANCIENT DOMAINS OF MYSTERY\nDeep in the mountainous ranges of the Drakalor Chain, Chaos has broken through into Ancardia and it's up to you to decide the fate of the entire realm. You control a single character with a wildy varying set of skills, talents, spells and other abilities. Customized equipment makes each race/class combination a very different experience. Explore a mostly randomized underworld, fight monsters, loot treasures and uncover the many secrets lurking in the world of Ancardia.\nJoin a generation of gamers in playing a remastered version of this classic rogue-like!\nWith an overhaul of the graphics, music, new playable races and classes, over 400 monsters, tens of thousands of items, crafting, magic, religion, corruption, randomized dungeons and so much more, this reimagined version is one of the most in-depth roguelikes on the planet.\nSo, come join us as we return to Ancardia and choose your fate.\nABOUT ADOM ON GOG\nADOM on GOG takes ADOM gameplay to the next level by introducing the following features (among others):\n70+ achievements,\ngame customization features (e.g. turning corruption off, increasing treasure rates adjusting monster lethality),\nghost creation - be haunted by dead player characters and try to win their treasures,\nstory mode - save and reload your games,\nexploration mode - use a wand of wishes to discover completely new sides of the game,\nchallenge mode - try to score highest under complex conditions in weekly challenge games,\nshared and global highscores,\npoint-based character generation,\nstar sign selection,\nand so much more.\nTHE FUTURE OF ADOM\nIs ADOM a complete game?

No. As long as there is interest in the game we will continue to evolve and enhance it.

    "description": "Taking place in the vibrant city of Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, Afterlove EP is a blend of visual novel, narrative adventure and rhythm game elements from the creator of Coffee Talk and What Comes After.\nStep into the shoes of Rama, a young musician struggling to move on with life after the death of their girlfriend, Cinta.\nWhilst his close friends and bandmates are all determined to help him move on, Rama has been stuck for more than a year. He’s neglecting his music, his mental health and his relationships.\nMaking things harder, he’s hearing Cinta’s voice inside his head, unsure if she is a spirit or part of his imagination.\nRama’s band has a critical gig in one month’s time. Either he gets serious about his music and delivers the new songs he has been promising or the band will move on without him.\nOver twenty-eight days and nights it will be your choices that determine the path Rama takes. Explore the city, choose which relationships to repair and which new ones to pursue. Come to terms with the past, rediscover your creative voice and help Rama shape a future for himself.\nDiscover modern day Jakarta through side-scrolling exploration, engage in deep and meaningful conversations with the characters of your choosing and jam with your band in rhythm game sections.\nPart of the burgeoning Indonesian indie game development scene, Afterlove EP seeks to create an authentic window into modern urban life in Indonesia.\nSet in the streets of Jakarta where several of the developers live or have lived, the game also features the distinctive, manga-inspired art of renowned Indonesian artist Soyatu (\n@soyacomu\n) and an original soundtrack from Indonesian indie band\nL’Alphalpha\n.\nABOUT THE DEVELOPER\nNo stranger to stories which tug at the heartstrings, Afterlove EP is the final project from renowned narrative designer, writer and developer, Mohammad Fahmi, who sadly passed away in March 2022 at the age of 32.\nPikselnesia is an Indonesian indie studio founded by Fahmi for the Afterlove EP project. After his passing, the team pledged to complete the game and bring his vision to fruition.\nFully remote, the team is spread across Indonesia and team members have worked on games including A Space for the Unbound, What Comes After and Hello Good Boy.\n© 2021 PT Pikselnesia Atma Fantasi.

Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.\nThe wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.\nFoxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?\nExperience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?\nWith hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.\nLaying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.",

    "description": "From city building to grand strategy, turn-based tactics to RTS, see more strategy games from\nHooded Horse\n.\nAs the struggle for survival against the Blightstorm continues, Against the Storm - Keepers of the Stone introduces a new species, two new biomes, and a selection of new buildings, orders, risks, and opportunities for any Viceroy up for the challenge. The Frogs join the effort to push back the storm, bringing their skill with stone masonry and love for water with them. Meanwhile, a changing of the tides has unlocked new potential in the distance – the Coastal Groves have finally become accessible after countless cycles spent under the deluge. Though they remain isolated and hard to reach, the ancient, submerged settlements of the area hold great treasures waiting to be uncovered. Meanwhile, unique opportunities present themselves in the once-thriving forests left barren by the march of industry – the Ashen Thicket is littered with broken trunks and remnants of a past age, awaiting a masterful Viceroy to restore its forgotten glory.\nAgainst the Storm - Keepers of the Stone includes:\nWelcome the dignified Frogs to your settlements and take advantage of their proficiency with stone masonry, the comfort they take in rainwater, and their ability to increase the rate at which new citizens join your settlements.\nHousing holds a special place among their desires – in their pride the new Frogs refuse to live in ordinary shelters, demanding instead highly upgradeable Frog Houses be constructed especially for them. Each of the four upgrade levels introduces significant changes to the functionality of the housing, making for a crucial pursuit in dire circumstances.\nExplore the new Coastal Grove biome where settlements start along the water, far from the easy reach of royal envoys and the benefits they provide. Rely instead on the Strider Port building – unique to the Coastal Grove biome, it allows you to launch expeditions seeking treasures buried in the surrounding waters. The Strider Port offers a fresh way to seek out new building designs with each expedition simply requiring a supply of food for the Water Strider and its rider alike – the more you’re willing to invest in supplies, the better your potential finds might be.\nBrave the new Ashen Thicket biome, ravaged by industrial exploitation and the Blightstorm alike. The barren lands here are home to the rare Thunderblight Shards – lightning-infused crystals that can be mined at great cost, crucial for forging Cornerstones using the Ashen Thicket’s unique Cornerstone Forge building. With only a limited number of opportunities to produce your own Cornerstones, you must strategically choose which conditions and rewards go hand-in-hand, with the option to take on penalties in the hopes of bolstering their benefit.\nNew rewards are added to the upgrade tree in the Smoldering City to benefit the new Frog species alongside 3 new Legendary Cornerstones, 1 new Epic Cornerstone, 3 new Rare perks, and 5 new Uncommon perks.\nPursue 12 new orders that reflect the Frogs and their capabilities, pushing Viceroys to upgrade houses, seek out a greater Frog population, tend to their specific needs, or otherwise take advantage of their unique strengths.\nThe new biomes will appear on the world map after the current cycle ends. To unlock Frogs as a playable species, you must reach level 9.\nEnjoy a new soundscape with 28 new tracks added to reflect the dangers and opportunities of the Coastal Grove and Ashen Thicket biomes.\nServe the Scorched Queen across new lands and challenges, with a brand new species at your side – with these keepers of the stone, you may yet push back the Blightstorm and the devastation it brings with it.",

    "description": "From city building to grand strategy, turn-based tactics to RTS, see more strategy games from\nHooded Horse\n.\nThe Blightstorm rages on as Against the Storm - Nightwatchers introduces a new species into the fray alongside two new biomes, new buildings, new deeds, new world events, and more for any Viceroy seeking additional options in the seemingly endless struggle. The Bats bring with them a talent for metallurgy and a disdain for weakness, growing more resolute when their compatriots falter.\nMeanwhile, as smugglers grow bold enough to defy the Scorched Queen, the harsh Rocky Ravines become an option for settlers – these barren lands are rich in ore and minerals. Viceroys building settlements among the scraggly rocks will find themselves reliant on black market traders while mining the basalt columns that grow here in place of trees.\nThose seeking more verdant fields will perhaps find suitable sites among the Bamboo Flats instead. Though lush with life, the heavy rainfall erodes the loose soil, and settlers must work carefully to appease a peculiar species local to the ecosystem if they want any chance at success: the Fluffbeak. If kept happy, this beast is able to produce fertilizer, giving the local Viceroy an opportunity to plan exactly where to enrich the soil and secure the future of their settlement.\nAgainst the Storm - Nightwatchers includes:\nThe newly added species, Bats, have little patience for weakness, having grown hardy and austere in their isolated underground halls. Fiercely devoted and stern, they bring their expertise with metals and a willingness to make sacrifices for the greater good. Once the Bats’ starting ability is unlocked, you will be granted access to the Manorial Court blueprint – use it to expel a member of a chosen species, leveraging this harsh punishment to motivate all who remain to work harder in the name of the Scorched Queen.\nThe Rocky Ravine biome presents an unforgiving landscape where even the trees are made of stone, and the Black Market will be a key partner in your success – with fluctuating prices and a notable lack of wood, you’ll need to leverage your plentiful stone and amber to acquire the resources needed to keep your settlement growing. But be warned – these criminals will quickly turn from merchants to miscreants, and while they present an excellent opportunity, they also expect debts to be paid in a timely manner.\nSettle the Bamboo Flats biome with the help of an unlikely ally – though the constant rain has left these regions devoid of any fertile soil, the giant Fluffbeak is able to produce copious amounts of fertilizer to help create areas of fertile soil and establish a flourishing settlement. Manage the Fluffbeak’s hunger, thirst, and warmth to keep it happy and reap the rewards, not just in the provision of fertilizer, but in the increased resolve and productivity of villagers inspired by the village mascot.\n3 new World Map Modifiers will bring harsher lands to conquer. From the Riverlands and their minimal space to places of great significance for the ancients, still watched by silent guardians that limit the number of Cornerstones that can be used, Viceroys will be pressed to seek solutions to these new challenges.\n3 new World Events introduce an increasingly powerful criminal organization, explosive alchemical experiments that threaten your carefully laid-out plans, and a tree-eating beast that inadvertently opens glades and unleashes the secrets hidden within them, whether you’re ready or not. Use these to secure powerful but temporary boons – from woodcutting automatons to the new Fuel Rod resource that doubles Rain Engine efficiency.\n3 new Legendary Cornerstones, 16 new Deeds, and 6 new Decorations have been added alongside new rewards to the upgrade tree in the Smoldering City.\nThe new biomes will appear on the world map after the current cycle ends. To unlock Bats as a playable species, you must reach level 11.\n27 new tracks added to reflect the growing world of Against the Storm.\nPunish the meek and push forth into harsher lands in service of the Scorched Queen – with the Bats by your side, there is little room for the weak-willed.",

After their victory, the Gods of Light unified the decaying bodies of the Gods of Darkness and created a new world.\nNow, the forces of darkness are awakening once again…\nAgarest: Generations of War includes many unique features that cannot be found in any other Strategy Role Playing Game. Here's a summary of some of the best:\nExtended Area\nExtended Area is the \"Linked Area\" set for both your party and your enemies. Each character in the game has a uniquely shaped extended area. When a character's turn comes around, all other characters in the Extended Area of the character in play (and characters in the extended areas of those characters!) can combine in an extended attack. This allows you to chain your party's attacks together, allowing access to more Arts and huge Combos!\nBlacksmith's Guild\nYou can upgrade various Items and Equipment at the Blacksmith's Guild in two different ways:\nBy Enhancement: You can enhance equipment to a maximum of Level 5. Once an Item is enhanced to Level 5, you can convert the Item, changing it into something else. This process is irreversible and the original item is lost. Experimentation reveals some great new items!\nThrough Alchemy: Alchemy allows you to combine several items to create a single, more powerful piece of equipment. While you lose the items used in the alchemy, you gain a powerful new piece of equipment and permanent access to your new item in the Shop! Alchemy can create powerful new weapons and armour but occasionally a Smithing Accident will occur and the smith will create a different item than what you expected!\nThe \"Soul Breed\" system\nAgarest takes place across 5 generations of heroes, starting with your first character, Leonhardt. During each generation you will build relationships with 3 different female party members, and at the end of each generation's story arc you must choose to marry one of the girls.\nYour choice of marriage partner is restricted to girls who've grown fond of you over a particular generation. Your options are determined by your choices during conversations at certain points of the story.\nThe girl you choose as your wife - and the strength of their relationship with you - will determine the abilities of the main character in the next generation of the story. You'll have to experience multiple play throughs to see all of the character possibilities open to you! What heroes might you create?\nChoose the path of Darkness or Light through a truly epic story, spanning multiple generations.\nBattle hundreds of different creatures using an array of character abilities, in a compelling and innovative turn-based combat system.\nBuild your ultimate army of warriors and master Extra Skills, Special Arts and Over Kills to defeat colossal enemies!\nUnite with your chosen heroine and use the “Soul Breed” system to shape the fate of the next generation of heroes.\nAgarest: Generations of War ©2013 COMPILE HEART / RED.

Once an Item is enhanced to Level 5, you can convert the Item, changing it into something else. This process is irreversible and the original item is lost. Experimentation reveals some great new items!\nThrough Alchemy: Alchemy allows you to combine several items to create a single, more powerful piece of equipment. While you lose the items used in the alchemy, you gain a powerful new piece of equipment and permanent access to your new item in the Shop! Alchemy can create powerful new weapons and armour but occasionally a Smithing Accident will occur and the smith will create a different item than what you expected!\nThe \"Soul Breed\" system\nAgarest takes place across 5 generations of heroes, starting with your first character, Leonhardt.

So while existing fans of the series will of course see some familiar features and faces popping up, newer players will not need to have played the previous games to understand and enjoy this instalment of the story.\nOne day, the world was enveloped by a mysterious blinding light causing terrible destruction. The central continent, from where the light is believed to have originated, fell silent and slowly, demons began to emerge and spread throughout the world like a plague.\nSometime afterwards, a young man by the name of Weiss, suffering from amnesia, encounters the enigmatic Eva who tells him that he has committed the sin of deicide. In order to atone for his crime he learns that he must become the \"Vessel\" in which the power of the divinity he slaughtered is to be stored. This power will be used to resurrect the one whose life Weiss stole, for those who betray the divine will pay for their sins in the space which separates salvation and damnation, as will their progeny...\nNew Agarest Universe\n: Roam freely and watch the story unfold in this newly designed Universe and battle colossal enemies in over 80 hours of compelling gameplay!\nRevamped Battle System\n: Engage your ultimate warriors in a new faster paced combat system with real tactical depth and a wealth of character customization.\nHD Graphics\n: Enjoy the all-new environments, CGs, and your favourite animated character portraits in stunning high-definition.\nMini-games\n: Engage in Bathtub, Shiatsu, and Massage mini-games!\nSoul Breeding Returns\n: See your favorite heroines evolve over several decades through each passing generation.\nChoose Your Path\n: It’s not just the heroines you unite with but also the choices you make that will significantly change the outcome of the story.\nAgarest: Generations of War 2 ©2015 COMPILE HEART / RED.

    "description": "Eternal Lords is the major, second expansion for the acclaimed strategy game Age of Wonders III, marking one year of continuous development since its release. With the introduction of the Tigran and Frostling races and the new Necromancer class, players must adapt to a world on the brink of cataclysmic change. New features such as the Race Governance system, which allows players to tailor features of each race in their empire to meet their strategic needs, add new layers of depth to empire development and diplomacy. Embrace the forbidden powers and reign for eternity!\nEternal Lords Content Includes:\nThe Necromancer Player Class:\nThe Necromancer’s legions march to establish an eternal kingdom, unifying all the world’s races in death. The Necromancer creates spectacular undead units, such as the Bone Collector, a crablike monstrosity which eats corpses to strengthen itself. Other units are summoned, such as the Banshee, which invokes despair in the hearts of the living. The Necromancer’s dark magic allows players to convert towns to cities of the dead, filled obedient Ghoul minions.\nTorch Bearers, Grey Guard and Shadow Born Leader Specializations:\nThese Champions of Good, Neutrality and Evil respectively deepen the alignment mechanics and provide players of all classes powers to withstand the challenges of the new age. Learn spells to summon mighty Angels, end game units who embody the essence of each alignment.\nFrostling Player Race:\nFrostlings are a race of humanoids that emerged from the frozen north. Lead by their Ice Queens, they embark on frequent raids in warmer lands. Their seafaring skills, offensive fighting style and frost magic spread fear among the coastline villages they pillage. Frostings are even more deadly in their home arctic clime, where they build cities carved into the very glaciers they hope will someday grow to cover the earth.\nTigran Player Race:\nThese feline humanoids hail from remote desert lands. They worship the sun and track the cycle of day and night; life and death. Their natural curiosity about necromancy and the passing of regal souls into kingdoms of glory in the afterlife inspires them to construct massive tombs. Tigrans are natural sprinters, capable of moving far faster in combat than members of the other races, and are familiar with shape changing magic, allowing their mystics to transform into Dire Panthers.\nEternal Lords Story Campaign.\nAn epic battle of the forces of creation: fire versus ice, life versus death. As Arvik, heir to a broken Frostling kingdom, you awaken forbidden necromantic powers to reclaim your realm. You will find unlikely allies, and must choose between your Frostling roots or the full potential of your new found powers.\nCosmic Happenings:\nThe dawn of the Eternal Lords has triggered cataclysmic events that can radically shift fortunes. These events occur as the game progresses, disrupting the best laid plans and providing opportunities for cunning players to gain an advantage. Falling Clouds can fill the world with mist, giving shock weakness to machine and armored units and reducing sight range, while the March of the Troll King can cause armies of trolls to rampage across the map.\nRace Governance:\nRelations are now tracked per race, allowing you to make careful decisions who to make ware with. Declaring war on an Elven city might give you a quick conquest, but don’t expect your Elven citizens to be happy about it afterwards! As your relations with each race improve, you will be able to earn unique racial perks that boost your armies and economy.\nUnifier Victory Condition.\nWhen reaching maximum Governance for a Race, the production of a Unity Beacon is unlocked in cities of that race. Building Unity Beacons for the number of races set in the victory condition, makes you the Great Unifier and wins the game\nA dozen Mysterious Map Locations:\nCapture the Reef Colony Dwelling, home to horrors of the deep, and discover new treasure sites such as the Lich’s Castle, Temple of the Sands and the Hall of the Forefathers to benefit your empire.\nPlus New Hero Items\n, Standalone Scenarios and more! Eternal Lords incorporates feedback from the community and coincides with a free update adding: Play by Email \"a-synch\" Multiplayer Mode: which lets you play Age of Wonders III when you want. You get an email notification when it’s your turn, boot the game and Triumph’s server automatically sends and receives your game data for you.\nNew content and features are integrated into the updated Random Map Generator.\nAge of Wonders, the Age of Wonders logo, Triumph Studios and the Triumph Studios logo are trademarks of Triumph Studios B.V..

    "description": "In the stardust and disunity of the collapsed Star Union, an insidious new race of conquerors has come to lay claim to the galaxy. Deploy and destroy as the merciless Shakarn, a vicious race of conniving lizardmen with holographic disguises ready to deceive, disrupt and disintegrate the last strongholds of human might. Utilize light and sound trickery to sabotage and scatter your foes from the inside out, overwhelm them with brutish alien force, or form the most unlikely of alliances: the choice is yours. Choose quickly though, as new environmental catastrophes can strike without warning, and enemies may spring from unexpected places. The Shakarn empire is ready to strike your enemies down, but do not make the mistake of being overconfident. Never forget that the greatest threats often come from above…\nNew Features\n●\nThe Shakarn\n- Planetfall's newest playable faction gives new meaning to cold-blooded. These ruthless lizardmen can deploy units from the Zardas caste with holographic disguises to mimic and confuse foes or deploy the brutal Domok to crush them outright.\n●\nThe Therians\n- This NPC race of sophisticated warriors has accelerated evolution by fusing their DNA with that of animals. Under the rule of the mysterious Deer, this rogue militia has fled their home planet to colonize new worlds, but you won’t catch them in the headlights! They are formidable as friends or foes.\n●\nVoidbringer Invasions\n- Face the ultimate late-game challenge as the enigmatic Voidbringers use trans-dimensional warfare to rain down legions of enthralled soldiers across your empire. Destroy their beacons and extinguish their colossal armies, or submit and become enthralled yourself to conquer the world in the name of the void.\n●\nWorld Events\n- Battles can now be spontaneously shaken up by over 20 different environmental catastrophes covering everything from pirate uprisings to superstorms to solar flares. Each will require adaptive playstyles to truly test a player's mastery of Planetfall.\n●\nAdditional Campaign Missions\nVenture into new territory as the Shakarn begin their invasion of the Egalitarian League of Planets with two new campaign maps. The humans thought they had conquered everything, but the vast galaxy of Planetfall continues to grow...\n●\nConquered Worlds\nIn this team juggernaut-style game mode, form an alliance to topple a formidable kingpin. One player starts with a titanic empire, and all others unite to crumble their dominion to dust. Don’t get too envious-- those who get used to being behind the sword may soon find themselves in front of it.\n© 2018 Paradox Interactive AB, AGE OF WONDERS: PLANETFALL, and PARADOX INTERACTIVE are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of Paradox Interactive AB in Europe, the U.S., and other countries.

    "description": "AI War 2\nis a grand strategy/RTS hybrid that reverses many of the conventions of both genres.  Take territory without attracting attention, build your empire with care, and adapt to an ever-evolving galactic battleground.  It's also \"a sequel to [Arcen's] enormo-space RTS AI War, which we called\n'one of this year's finest strategy games'\nback in 2009\" (Tom Sykes, PC Gamer)\nThe most devious and acclaimed artificial intelligence in strategy gaming evolves.\nMost recent is 2021's Paradigm Shift.  Every year since 2018, this AI has become more devious -- and the factions facing it, subordinate to it, or simply neighbors with it grow more numerous and more lifelike.\nThe premise is simple: you've already lost the war.  The entire galaxy belongs to other factions, mostly the AI.  You are starting with one small planet in a sea of hostile territory, and you must endeavor not to draw too much notice from the AI.  Your job is to carefully evaluate targets, strategically expand your territory\njust enough\nto run your fleets and defensive networks, and then strike at the heart of the AI(s) when you are ready.\nAI War 2 is meant to be both accessible and deep.  Early 2021 has seen major improvements to make the midgame easier to get into for new players, plus a more forgiving Science system and a much more powerful Hacking system.  Q3 2021 is going to introduce a new Expert mode for those who want the more extreme sort of challenge that comes from having elements of permanent loss, more reasons to hold disadvantageous positions, and so on.  Which mode you choose to play will always remain a personal choice.\nUnexpected Technical Advancements\nIn the twelve years since we coded the first AI War, we've made a lot of improvements to our simulation engine, which is now running on top of the Unity 3D engine.  However, AI War 2 has presented some truly unique technical challenges, mainly involving running insane amounts of AI and simulations in a massively parallel fashion.  We've been able to harness the power of modern multi-core processors to a degree that most game simulations cannot, and our challenge from 2020 onward has been to bring that into the multiplayer realm.  While multiplayer currently remains in beta, it is also a bit of a technical showcase.\nMod support is heavily embraced by this game, and having mods be multiplayer-safe (or have deep access to change parts of the core simulation in general) is not typical for games as a whole, let alone this genre.  We've managed to make multiplayer a self-repairing affair, which is beneficial both for playing with friends on different OSes and hardware, and for having most mod-code mistakes be corrected by the core game.\nThe AI has dramatically improved in intelligence every year since 2018, and your framerate is also decoupled from your simulation performance.  You can have a great machine with 120fps during heavy battles, and a friend at 30fps and you both stay in sync and the actually simulation doesn't slow down. You can speed up and slow down the simulation without any extra load on your CPU, which is very helpful to avoid any boring waiting around, and you can pause at will.\nThe interface respects your time by automating things that you would do the same 95% of the time anyway. For that other 5% there are indeed advanced features such as placing spy nanites, tweaking or disabling the rules of automation, or redesigning your fleet compositions as much as you want.  Hacking is one of the most interesting ways to customize your existing fleet leaders, as you can give them unusual upgrades or even transform them into new versions of their class.\nStreamlined, yet deeper.\nSometimes when a sequel says it's \"streamlined,\" it can really mean \"dumbed down.\" And there are indeed fewer tiny choices to be made in some areas here: you don't have to decide how to wash each dish; you have a dishwasher. And it's a good thing you do, to be honest, because the rabbit hole of complex and confounding scenarios goes as deep as you want it to.\nIf you want to play at a level approaching Expert, you'll need that spare brainpower to design your fleets, manage multiple fronts at once, juggle offense and defense, and continually revise your empire design to suit your needs as the campaign unfolds.  If you want to play more casually, that is absolutely okay as well, and the game can be much more forgiving while still providing a lot of interesting macro choices.\nThere's too much to memorize (but tooltips are always right there, anyway), and there's always an unfamiliar element.  Clicking fast won't help you. To win the AI War, you'll have to improvise, adapt, and use your wits.\nAs it should be.\nHow About Some Highlights?\nMany optional factions, each with their own goals and strategies, create a living galaxy.\nThe fleets system gives you tons of ships that can be organized and distributed with a minimum of fuss.\nScience upgrades are simple to manage, but provide many options on how to approach any given campaign based on your preferences and what you find in the wild.\nHack the enemy, hack your allies, hack yourself.  Hacking points are limited, but extremely powerful ways to get more ships or capabilities, directly weaken enemies, or even steal from enemies.\nA ton of map types, and with a lot of sub-options to make them even more varied.\nOutguard can be hired as a way of deploying surprise mobile forces whever you need, and many factions can be allies.\nWarden, Hunter, and Praetorian Guard sub-fleets of the AI provide for new challenges (and sometimes opportunities) in how both you and the AI interact with each other.\nCrazy moddability, with many levers available in easily-accessible XML.  A number of player-supported mods are shipped directly with the game (defaulting to off) so that you always have the latest version of them and don't have to hunt for them to download them.\nWhat's New Compared To The Original?\nMore approachable gameplay, but with a rabbit hole that goes as deep as ever.\nMore to do, in terms of moment to moment gameplay and choices.  More to find, more to conquer or be conquered-by.\nPolished gameplay mechanics, representing everything learned from first game’s six expansions (plus three years of development on this sequel).\nTrimmed fat: repetitive boring tasks have been automated or streamlined, but more options than ever have been added for you to customize things when you want to.  Our goal is never to waste your time, but always have an array of interesting challenges for you to pursue at once.\nRedesigned UI that gives you a ton of information and power right when you need it.\n1.5 hours of new music added to the 4.5 hour included score from the original game.\nMultithreading for modern performance, and a codebase that will not summon an elder god (recoded from the ground up for modern rigs).\nOver 1900 lines of spoken dialogue from more than 25 actors.",

    "description": "Veterans of Fleet Command will remember the Neinzul as swarmers who attrited to death. Well, those were just the forward scouts. The Neinzul Abyss will see you fighting with or against their full might. Behold, the true power of the Neinzul!  From the Evil Necromancer (that could be you) to the Eldritch Elderlings!\nNew Player Type! The Necromancer\nA new optional way to play the entire game!  Rather than playing as the usual Human Empire, playing as a Necromancer gives you control over a mobile fleet that feasts on the living from other universes.  Capture enemy guard posts, make skeletons and wights out of enemy ships, and quest against the Templars and the Neinzul Elderlings.  Development on this massive new playstyle took an entire year, and the word from most of our testers is that this is their new favorite way to experience the game.\nFor multiplayer, there is an optional Necromancer Sidekick that can play alongside human or Necromancer empires, or in single-player or multi-player you can have any number of Necromancer Empires on their own or with other player types.\nWhat to Expect\nWith the focus of this DLC being the Neinzul and their unique civilization, You’ll be interacting with them for nearly every minute of the game in the form of six new minor factions. From the fractured roaming enclaves, the ever roaming migrants, to the terrifying and eldritch Elderlings, no two minor factions will ever feel identical to each other.\nIf these factions aren’t of interest to you, then perhaps the all new evil and insidious Necromancer player type is. When playing as the Necromancer faction, you can choose to either play it as an entirely new way to play the game as a Necromancer Empire, or as a supportive role in multiplayer games as the Necromancer Sidekick. As per the norm, new ships, mechanics, and buildings that come with DLCs have been added in to spice up the game even more. More on those later, for now, let’s talk about the big factions!\nNPC Faction: Neinzul Sappers\nThe Neinzul Sappers are part of a Neinzul hive mind that has been able to integrate themselves swiftly into our own ranks. They are willing and able to assist us in our resistance against the AI. While they haven’t said why, the AI is hostile to them and will attempt to exterminate them on sight.\nDeployment of turrets and watchtowers with Neinzul Sapper patrol units are a common sight wherever they entrench themselves. They are similar to the AI Warden Fleets subroutine, being defensive in nature, but they are also capable of supporting us while attacking. If they notice us attacking a nearby AI world, they may send in special units that deploy turrets mid battle to assist us.\nNPC Faction: Neinzul Custodians\nThe Neinzul Custodians are the result of a Neinzul hive mind that has refused to divide itself. In their prime, the Neinzul Custodians were a part of a grand Neinzul empire that spanned many stars, all under a single hive mind.  The great shattering of the Neinzul empire came when the Hive mind could take no more. Fracturing into countless enclaves, they now undergo a civil war, just like we have.\nEach enclave will work with other enclaves under a custodian faction to mutually survive. While a custodian faction may ally with us, another may choose to side with the AI. There is also the possibility of even the Dark Spire and Dark Zenith acquiring an alliance with these Neinzul Custodians. Either way, it is best we prepare for both new allies and enemies to appear before us.\nNPC Faction: Neinzul Migrants\nWhen we were alerted to strange wormhole signatures appearing on a nearby planet, we found countless ships matching Neinzul profiles pouring out, engaging the AI. The smaller ships, while being destroyed in droves, were broadcasting signals of friendly nature.\nAfter reaching the location of these strange wormholes, a large Neinzul vessel was spat out of the wormhole before it closed in on itself. It appears that it simply desires to leave this galaxy and migrate elsewhere to ensure its survival. Your science team believes it may be worth helping these new migrating Neinzul by escorting them to safety, as they may yield unexpected rewards. The choice is yours on whether to help them or leave them to distract the AI.\nNPC Faction: Neinzul Wild Hives\nNeinzul forces which our scientists have creatively named “Wild Hives” are animalistic in nature. They have refused any and all communication attempts, and have begun seizing and infesting all metal rich asteroids they come across.\nThe Wild Hives use them as both resource harvesting locations and breeding grounds. They have even been witnessed doing this to our own asteroids, stealing them away from us!\nFortunately, we can calibrate our weapons to merely sterilize the Neinzul from the metal rich asteroids. However, it’s to be expected that the Wild Hives won’t exactly take this lying down.\nIf two different Wild Hives meet on a planet, they will fight for control over the metal mines, and blast anyone that isn’t themselves.\nMore Details On The New Necromancer Player Type\nThe Necromancer is here to terrorize your enemies! Playing radically differently from the standard Human Empire, The Necromancer is all about converting their enemies into mindless corpses to throw them back at their former comrades.\nFrom the smallest of strike craft, to the largest of ships, all shall become your new undead minions! Strikecraft become skeletons, guardian or frigate level ships become Wights, and dire guardians turn into mummies.  You can even capture AI guard posts for your own use!\nOn the one hand, you spend science to upgrade your units, just like the Human Empire. On the other, you can acquire new skeleton, wight, and other upgraded variants of your basic units from Templar Rifts.\nNecromancers don’t have command stations, but instead, they have Necropoleis (the plural Greek form of Necropolis)! A Necropolis is like a Spire City in that it has a modular build system, with buildings taking up hexes instead of casings.\nAnd instead of a Home Command Station, Necromancers get a Phylactery. Unlike the human Home Command Station, the Necromancer can spend a new resource, Essence, to swap the Phylactery’s location with another Necropolis. This even works as the Phylactery is dying, preventing a game over. However, if the Necromancer has no Essence or any non-crippled Necropoleis though, it’s curtains for them! Hexes can be devoted to various buildings, such as defensive totems, flagship-supporting unit-homes, or shipyards.\nYou can choose to build a Minor Necropolis, which will support your flagship, a defensive Necropolis, which focuses on holding down the location it is at, or a Major Necropolis which gives you another flagship to work with. If you spend some Essence, you can upgrade your Necropoleis or Phylactery to increase their hex count.\nThe Necromancer doesn’t require metal to function. Also… the Necromancer is Evil with a capital E. This translates to getting the Science, Hacking and Essence resources by murdering and killing specific units in combat, rather than just gathering it passively at planets you capture. What kind of units? Well…\nNPC Faction: The Templars\nThe Templars are here to stop the Necromancer by purging it in Holy Fire. Standing against the Darkness and bathed in Holy Light, they are immune to being corrupted by the Necromancer and will routinely launch Crusades against the Necromancer. While these Crusades start out as weak raids, led by simple Messenger Heralds, they will eventually grow into truly large holy incursions led by Harbingers of Light. Templars are your main source of science and hacking points.\nMost Templars you slay will reward you with science, and some reward hacking as well. As the game progresses, the Templar will release Templar Constructors to build Encampments around the map. While Templar Encampments are weak, and don’t offer any high quality or quantity troops to attack you with, they can eventually become Templar Fastnesses which can definitely start bringing in the pain with more well equipped soldiers and are more capable of defending themselves.\nEventually, a Templar Fastness can become a Templar Castle, which is capable of repelling Necromancer attacks while offering the highest quality troops to attack you with. When the Templars launch a Crusade against you, they will spawn a leader unit. As the leader unit passes through the map, it rallies any Templar units it comes across to its cause, especially if it passes a Templar Encampment, Fastness or Castle.  Destroying these buildings and leader units grants a hefty amount of science and hacking points.\nTemplar Rifts are vulnerable wormholes that lead to the Templar’s worlds with their civilians living in fear of being slain by the Necromancer, which is why they will attempt to defend their rifts. If a Necromancer is able to reach a rift, it may siphon the rift, dooming those on the other side in exchange for more powerful units, or sometimes, Essence.\nAs you fight on, more rifts spawn, with more Templars coming out to defend them. Now while these Templar fellows may be the ones trying to stop you, they’re not the only ones you have to contend with. While fighting Templars rewards you with science and hacking, they only occasionally hand you Essence. It’s time to get your primary source of Essence. Introducing…\nNPC Faction: The Elderlings\nThese giant Neinzul have somehow managed to survive and separate themselves from a hivemind, and have grown to absolutely massive proportions, with some growing to be as large as a moon. Apathetic to the AI and Templars, they will engage the Necromancer at first sight. Each Elderling slain grants you Essence! Essence is used to upgrade your flagships and Necropoleis so they can become even more powerful in waging their war against the Templar and AI. Without Essence, the Templar will eventually gain the upper hand and purge you from the galaxy.\nElderlings are hatched from giant eggs strewn about the galaxy, and as they mature, they will lay their own eggs to perpetuate their existence. This ensures a steady supply of Essence will flow to you. However, you should regularly cull their numbers. For the separation of Elderlings and Hive Mind has taken a toll on their sanity. And when they run out of sanity? Things may get… ugly.\nElderlings can also be hacked. You can chose to reveal what territory it calls home, or forcefully transform it into a more powerful variant that doesn’t drop Essence, but allows whichever Necromancer slays it the ability to transform their flagships with its traits. Fancy breathing fireballs at your enemies?\nHowever, if you’re feeling truly brave, you can decide to use the resonant frequencies of an Elderling and transmit a signal that will agitate something truly horrifying… Something as old as the stars themselves… But just think about how much Essence you could harvest from such an entity!\nNew Challenger Approaching: The Venators!\nThe newest additions to the AI’s roster. The AI has been paying attention to what forces you use, and will now react accordingly. Venators are ships that are designed to hunt down specific units, with each Venator hand tailored to do its job exceptionally well.\nAre you using high amounts of zombification? Out come the Debauched Venators, who are immune to zombification.\nAre you using sniper units to fight the AI so it can’t retaliate? The Quaint Venator will put a stop to that real quick and force you to engage it in close combat.\nAre you using Golems or Arks? Here come the Foppish Venators to ruin your day. You had better vary your tactics, as becoming a one trick pony will cause the AI to respond accordingly and it will deploy the appropriate counter.\nWhat else is there?\nWith All the big new factions being hyped up, it’s time to finally address the smaller, but no less important things that this expansion adds.\nOrbital ships, including new capturable Wards that you can use with any fleet.\nCorrosive weapons, which eats away at a target over time, while ignoring shields. Very powerful against shield heavy units.\nSelf Assembly allows a ship to repair itself whenever it fires its weapon. Unlike Vampirism, which is reliant on the actual damage dealt and is a shipwide trait, Self Assembly is a weapon trait and allows the ship using it to repair itself at a consistent rate.\nWards are units that orbit around another unit or building, allowing them to fulfill a multitude of purposes, be it defense, offense, or support! They come in both traditional shipline and drone variants. From the slice 'n dice Scythe Ward, to the ship resurrecting Angelic Ward, they are all fun to use. Put them on a basic transport and it can become more than just a simple shuttle for your forces. Additionally, they give you a greater incentive to upgrade forcefield and mobile fort tech.\nDestroyers are ships that are centered around producing wards to aid in their battles. Similarly to cruisers, they are considered elite ship lines, so only 1 destroyer line can fit in each transport. While weaker than a cruiser, they do come in pairs.\nSeveral new ships: there are some new and exciting ships for you to find and use, from the Blade Spawner frigate, to the shoving Bouncer, there’s plenty of new variety for you to toy around with!\nThree brand new map types, Squares, Dissonance and Crazy Branching have been added to fight the AI across. Crazy Branching in particular has a ton of customizable settings for those who are crazy enough to try this map!\nEight new AI types to challenge yourself against. The Aggressor AI will drown you under border aggression, while the Panopticon AI is content to watch you suffer through its many eyes. If you’re really daring, the Skirmisher AI is all too happy to drop Venators on you right out the get go!\nOptional \"Showdown Devices\": allows for an alternative win condition where you get and hold four mysterious devices on four planets.  Capturing three out of four of them will trigger an all-out war which, if you can survive it, will lead to victory for humanity.\nOptional \"Brutal Guardian Lairs\": These shattered moons hide a terrible secret within them, the Brutal Guardians! They are much more powerful than Dire Guardians, and will spawn a Brutal Guardian in 5 minutes when it first detects you and every 30 minutes afterwards.\nAs this is the final DLC for AI War 2, we are truly grateful to both those that stuck with us from the beginning, to those who are just getting started with AI War 2. This game was a true passion project, and development would’ve never been possible without you, the community. It’s kind of hard to believe this is the end, huh?\nFrom vast overhauls such as the fleet system, to Global Command Augmenters turned into Turret Schematic Servers, AI War 2’s history is truly encyclopedic, and the patch notes alone could probably use up at least half a fully grown tree if printed on paper! This isn’t quite the end for AI War 2, as we are certain that bugs will crop up that need to be squashed, and we want to support any modders that happen to share some of their works with us. The game will be updated here and there, and the unit encyclopedia will be updated very soon, but overall, the game is mostly feature complete. It’s time for AI War 2 to close in style.\nThank you for playing!",

    "game_title": "AI War 2: The Spire Rises",
    "description": "The Spire Rises introduces the Spire race, with some factions helping you into open warfare, and others being quiet neighbors or in their own  war.  There are new units and arks, a ton of new turrets to defend with, and the insidious Scourge. There are new mechanics, and modular ships!\nContent Variety\nThis expansion adds a lot of welcome variety to every game you play, without being overwhelming.  Thirty new kinds of turret make the various tech options more well-rounded, and make your own planets as well as enemy planets more unique and interesting.  This doesn't increase the learning curve, since the normal method is to evaluate things as you go (rather than memorizing or coming up with a \"perfect\" meta) anyway.\nAside from the mass of new turrets, there are five new Arks that provide a variety of strange and interesting new abilities as fleet leaders.  There are other new capturables to find in any campaign, and some fan-favorite strikecraft and frigates have been adapted from the original AI War into this game (and made even more interesting).\nThese aspects are part of any game once you have the DLC, and make the game a richer experience in general.  There's also some new music!  However, there are also several notable opt-in new factions:\nOption For Open War\nThe Fallen  Spire faction is another fan-favorite adapted from the original AI War, but massively expanded and overhauled in this sequel.  The core premise is that you shift from hiding and fighting from the shadows to instead growing an increasing number of large alien cities that work under your orders.  As you grow your Spire forces, you can either choose to just augment a normal-style campaign, or you can build so many cities and have such massive armies that the AI starts freaking out and recalling its own super-units from its other war outside the galaxy.\nSeeing your massive Spire ships in battle against the dismayed Exo War Units of the AI can be... extremely satisfying.  A year on after this DLC's initial release, and there are some players who just don't want to play the game any other way -- which is great!  All of the normal features of the game, including any mods and other DLC, are compatible with this style of powerful Spire/Human empire.\nFor other players, a Spire game is something to play every so often as a change of pace, or to mix and match.  It's really not a rigid game mode, and allows you to push as far as you feel like going.\nThe Scourge\nThe Scourge are another optional faction that can be enabled via the lobby, or by activating a beacon in any game.\nThe Scourge provides a new way for the AI to be more active and attack the player in new ways. For example, they can build a few cloaked ships, then suicide them into your economic command stations behind your defenses.\nGive the player some juicy infrastructure targets that can be killed to weaken the enemy. It's always fun to destroy your enemies’ production facilities.\nThe scourge's units can organize themselves into Fireteams, granting them unprecedented flexibility and the ability to coordinate their attacks across the galaxy. Fireteams were developed to power the Scourge, though they have now also been made to work for a number of other factions.\nA giant scary ship called the Nemesis can come around if you REALLY get into it with them, but running into Subjugators prior to that is bad enough.\nThe Scourge are canonically allied to the AI, but you can have player-allied scourge or independently-teamed scourge (Marauders, Nanocaust and Scourge as a team is terrifying).\nLore: The AI felt a need for a subsidiary force to wipe out small annoyances, and not need to bother its main Processors with petty things. The AI took various races they have conquered in the Arcenverse, twisted them by genetic engineering, and fused them into a new and powerful force to crush its foes. The primary races the Scourge use are the Thoraxians, the Peltians, the Neinzul, the Evucks,the Burlusts… and even Spire.\nFallen Spire\nThe Fallen Spire are an optional faction that can be enabled via the lobby, or by activating a beacon in any game.\nThe core of the gameplay is epic battles to capture the spire relics, and powerful ships and cities you get as a result.\nGet some Really Big Weapons that scare the mess out of the AI.\nBuild entire spire cities of various complexities and styles, which upgrade as you build more cities and more structures.\nThe AI now has a reason and ability to bring back extra-galactic forces from their mysterious \"main war\" to fight you and the spire openly.\nYou have the freedom to push all the way to an alternative victory condition via this faction, or to just build up one or more cities and make use of the extra firepower.\nExperience the fallen spire on a gradient scale, doing some of it as you wish, not having to choose \"completely fallen spire\" or \"completely not fallen spire.\"\nLet us explore a bit more of the spire lore than we have in prior games.\nGive players a chance to \"smash the galaxy for fun and profit\" by going for a mark 7 city, well above the mark 5 level that is needed for the alternative victory condition. At this point you're just rubbing it in, but it feels so satisfying to be the big one for a change.\nLore: The AI has crushed the Spire empire in their home galaxy. Some Spire units have landed in our galaxy and they can rebuild their empire and take revenge.  The AI has captured a lot of Spire reactors and is experimenting to harness their power in cloaked research laboratories. There are also some hidden spire relics scattered about the galaxy from past battles.\nTurrets Expansion\nIn the base game, a couple of weapon technologies are missing turrets, and the defensive options to both you and the AI felt quite limiting. The turrets introduced in The Spire Rises aim to fix this by adding in 30 new turrets to the game. Some highlights include the Acid Turret, a supportive turret that causes any enemy it splashes in acid to take more damage from every source, the Crusher Turret, which functions like a miniature black hole, the Counter Sniper Turret which can obliterate those pesky Sentinel Gunboats and the Mini Fortress which can challenge whole fleets of AI ships and come out on top.\nReturning ships from Fleet Command\nVeterans of the first game may recognize these ships, as they are among the most popular and remoriable units from Fleet Command. They have made the transition into glorious 3d, and are ready to destroy all that oppose them again!\nThe Bombard fires off single shots at a very VERY slow rate… but whatever it hits isn’t gonna be there anymore!\nThe Tackle Drone Launcher Frigate itself only has a modest weapon. But as its name implies, it shoots out Tackle Drones. These drones can grab hostile units and pull them to the edge of the gravity well, taking them out of the fight, or pull them right into your awaiting units to get blown up!\nViral Shredders are a melee based unit that dish out a moderate amount of damage, but when they attack enough times, they replicate themselves for free. And then those fresh replications begin replicating themselves. And then THOSE replications begin replicating themselves. And then… you get the idea.\nTesla Torpedo Frigates are slow, and have a rather lackluster weapon… But their main source of damage comes from their devastating Lighting Torpedoes they spawn for truly disgusting area of effect damage. Swarmer type ships shudder at the thought of engaging these bad boys!\nAdditional Arks\nOver the course of the Human civil war, many exotic and unique ships called Arks were developed and used in combat. Many were destroyed during the brutal infighting, others were scrapped by the AI, and a few were simply lost to time. Well some of the missing ones have been detected and they are still salvageable for use to fight against the AI. They may not be as powerful as when they were in their prime, and some of the technology required to bring them back to fully operational status is missing, but with enough investment, they can become the powerful ships they once were. They also bring some unique gimmicks to the table, not found in vanilla.\nBelle Prime is an ambush specialist, boasting a very large amount of cloaking points and a surprisingly weak weapon for its weight class… But its main strength lies in its ambushing capabilities, dealing large damage if it has just arrived on a planet and outright eviscerating anything that has just arrived on a planet it is at. This makes it the ultimate wave destroyer or hacking response exterminator.\nGrand Salvage is an absolute menace to groups of smaller ships, pulling them in magnetically and then crushing them with the power of artificial gravity. It also projects a stronger than average gravity field, ensuring most ships do not escape its wrath.\nGreat A’Thomek functions as a tank for your entire fleet, drawing in fire from hostiles directed at your nearby ships with its attractant field, and shrugging it off with its defensive bonuses. This makes your fleet ridiculously hard to kill, outside of AoE weapons.\nNodorion Tortid may just be an artillery piece at first glance, but it also comes equipped with an attrition generator, damaging EVERYTHING that’s mobile over time. While the attrition damage is quite slow,  over the course of a battle, attrition damage can very quickly add up.\nSol Ater has rather lackluster weaponry, but its main utility lies in its ability to more efficiently subvert AI firewalls whenever it hacks something, causing the AI to have a decreased response to your hacking.\nBase Game Integration\nSeveral of the base game factions such as the Nanocaust, Macrophages and Marauders have new interactions with the Fallen Spire game mode. Whenever these factions are in play together, they may acquire some new spire themed units to empower themselves. Additionally, the Dark Spire aren’t… exactly happy that their Imperial cousins have arrived and may have some… shall we say violent opinions of them. We won’t spoil what happens, as that is best left for you to find out!\nThe 2022 Update\nWith the release of Zenith Onslaught and the upcoming Neinzul Abyss being chock full of content, we felt that The Spire Rises needed a bit more to stand beside those peers, and thus the free 2022 update aims to fill out even more content for you to experience and enjoy! The most notable part of this update are the new “Player Type” options. These radically change how you play the game from the start, and can switch up your entire strategy from the get go. Additionally, there are some new Spire minor factions to add some more chaos to your games, and they can drastically alter the tempo of the game. Without further ado, let’s meet the meat of the product!\nNew Player Types\nWith The Spire Rises, you’ll be able to play as 2 different empire types, those being the Ark Empire, and the Spire Infused Empire. Both require having a diverging mindset and strategies to be played effectively, as they redefine how you will play the game. This also opens up an avenue for more player types in the future, as well as give modders another toy to play around with!\nArk Empire: The Ark Empire may be familiar to those of you who played the AI War during its earliest incarnations. Instead of having a Home Command Station, you are instead given an Ark and 5 shiplines of your choosing to begin your resistance against the AI. However, unlike other flagships, if your starting flagship reaches 0 HP, then it's curtains for you. This type of empire can be considered more challenging than the normal empire because even though you have a starting Ark, you don’t start with a world claimed and you will lack starting battlestations. This empire type can be used in multiplayer games for players who want to take a more supporting role instead of an empire building one.\nSpire Infused Empire: This type of empire is intended for those who dislike the relic chasing aspect of the basic Fallen Spire mode, as this type of empire allows you to build Spire related ships and structures without having to use artifacts to start building Spire cities.  Although you are still restricted from just pumping out cities like no tomorrow, this “cutting out the middleman” aspect means you and the AI can get to blasting each other to pieces much faster than normal.\nModular Ships\nBack by popular demand, certain ships and ship lines can now be customized! This offers you unparalleled flexibility and adaptability in combating your enemies! You can even switch up your weapons mid battle to adapt as the battle progresses. Whenever you have a modular shipline, you can edit its loadout by selecting its relevant fleet, and clicking on the Modules button.\nFrom here, you can then pick which weapons and bonuses you’d like to apply to the ship/ship line. Maybe you want yourself some infinite range harassment loadout, or a tanky heavy hull to weather some extra damage. The modular ship system is point based. You start with a certain amount and as you mark up a modular ship/ship line, it gains additional points to spend, as well as more modules to use.\nAnd of course, the modding possibilities with this are endless. When it comes to modding modular ships, the only limit is your imagination!\nMore Spire Factions!\nSome new Spire entities have arrived in our galaxy, but these ones aren’t exactly friendly. They can quite easily swing the entire state of the game on a whim, as befitting the Spire race’s power. What they are exactly doing in our region of space isn’t known, as there should be nothing of note to them, yet here they are. This just goes to show how unknowingly incomprehensible the Spire race truly is when we compare ourselves to them.\nThe Chromatic Horror\nRivaling the Devourer Golem shock factor, the Chromatic Horror is an absolutely massive Spire entity, with inscrutable motives. Unlike the Zenith Devourer Golem which simply eats to survive, the Chromatic Horror appears to bend space and time around itself.  Simply being near it causes those affected to be randomly warped to a different location in the gravity well. This can shift an entire gravity well’s defenses from neat and orderly to chaotic and random. You, the AI and even other minor factions are not safe from this otherworldly entity. While it can be taken down, it will merely appear elsewhere some time later. Perhaps it went back in time before it was about to be destroyed? Either way, this… thing… is here to stay and ruin everyone’s defensive setups.\nThe Spire Dyson Spheres\nThe Zenith aren’t the only ones with Dyson Spheres. The Spire’s version of the dyson sphere however appears to be much more “active”, and are much more territorial. While they may adopt a “You don’t bother me, I don’t bother you” attitude, they are also a treasure trove of technology. If you’re feeling particularly brave (or crazy) you can attempt to hack the spheres for a chance to obtain warheads or interplanetary weapons based off of their technology.\nBe aware though… these Spire spheres will definitely hold a grudge towards you for doing these hacks. Above all however, they absolutely hate the Dark Spire, and will engage in warfare with them if they are present. This can very quickly turn the entire galaxy into one full of endless mayhem, as everyone begins shooting at everyone. While there are more intricacies in how they work, that is best left unsaid so you can get the full experience in game!\nWhat Else Is There?\nIn addition to all of these big bulky additions, there are several smaller scale ones. Not everything needs to be grand in size to be enjoyed, and good things come in small packages as well.\nMinor Capturables can now be found around the galaxy, such as the Lost Energy Reactor, which boosts your energy by a minor amount. These small structures can provide a modest bonus to your empire, but also increase AIP by 1 upon death, making them almost inconsequential to lose.\nSeveral new mechanics are introduced in this DLC. Harmonic increases the damage of a unit if more of the same unit are on the same planet gravity well. Damage amplification increases the amount of damage taken by a target by either a base amount (+25 damage from all attacks) or a multiplier (attacks deal 1.5x damage against this target). Drone guns shoot out a controllable unit that attritions slowly over time, allowing for carrier type units. There are a few more, but that would require me to write an entire short essay.\nDoomsday approaches! Something is tearing the galaxy apart piece by piece, causing entire planets to be outright destroyed without any forewarning. This will over the course of the game cause the galaxy to shrink in size, and things may end up claustrophobic with you and the AI literally within spitting distance at one another. You don’t have to worry about any planets you control or the AI HW being destroyed during Doomsday, but careful consideration of your position should still be taken, as all planets will always be insured to connect to at least one other planet, meaning no, you can’t just get lucky and seal off a troublesome minor faction. This option is enabled in the General tab in lobby setup.\nMore music, courtesy of the amazing and talented Pablo Vega, who has worked on prior Arcen titles, including AI War: Fleet Command! Hear the sheer awe inspiring Spire race’s testaments transcribed into music form! The Scourge also have their own sinister theme as well!\nAdded To The Base Game Concurrent With This Expansion\nA lot of things for the base game got major upgrades, at no charge to you, as we created this expansion.\n“Fire teams” from the scourge were backported into the AI itself, and the scariest other factions, making the AI vastly smarter in general.\nImprovements to targeting and other AI efficiency and performance improvements benefit all the factions, expansion or otherwise.\nA major upgrade to the lighting and materials used in the game makes everything prettier.  We had to retouch all of the existing ships and structures from the base game to make this happen.\nLoads of requested features, such as the ability to load quick starts (or even savegames) into the lobby for further customization before starting a new game.\nThe Extragalactic War features that the AI brings out against the Fallen Spire are technically part of the base game, so that any other faction or mod can use them in the future if desired.  We didn’t want to gate that off.\nHow Does This Compare To AI War Classic?\nAI War 2 grows even larger with this new massive expansion, bringing this plus the base game roughly on par with the amount of content in AI War Classic plus its first four expansions.  But that downplays the fact that we’re really emphasizing quality over quantity, despite the sheer scope of things.\nThere was never a faction like the Scourge in AI War Classic, because that was one of the many things that the old engine simply couldn’t support -- however, the “hybrid hives” that were a fan favorite were the original inspiration for the Scourge.  The “fire teams” concept that is used in the Scourge was such a massive upgrade to the general AI that we backported it to most of the base game factions in AI War 2.  But even so, the Scourge stands alone as your most adaptable and devious enemy, thanks largely to its ship design and distributed economy and upgrade mechanics.\nThe first AI War did have the Fallen Spire in its third expansion, and that faction is now returning with this expansion, and that was always a fan-favorite item.  We thought that the original Fallen Spire was great, but it was also pretty narrow in the experiences it could provide simply due to the constraints of the original game.  The sequel’s version introduces more ways to capture relics (train robberies!), vastly more interesting and unique AI forces to fight your titans (Extragalactic War units!), and a ton more Spire City buildings for far more unique and interesting construction on your part.\nBeyond that, some favorite strikecraft/frigates from the first game are returning with this expansion, but then the turrets and Arks that this expansion adds are all-new and use a variety of new mechanics (deathgrip, where ships do extra damage to ships they tractor, is a favorite).\nThe first game tended to include a bit of everything in every expansion (ships, maps, AI types, factions, etc), and sometimes that led to some of the elements being kind of watered-down, especially in later expansions.  With this sequel, our approach is a lot more custom-tailored for any expansions we do.  We pack in a ton of value for the price to anything we do, but we also keep things more thematic and focused, and hope to have each expansion feel more unique and rich because of it.",

You may face new AI types, capture yet more golems, and choose if you wish to encounter the planet-eating Zenith Miners.\nThe Story\nIn our normal universe, the Zenith aliens are long dead; only the mindless automatons called Golems are left behind, millennia after the fall of their civilization.\nOne day, in the middle of our war with the AI, the first of an oncoming horde of Zenith came through from a neighboring part of what scientists can clearly now tell is a multiverse.  These are Zenith in their prime, confused as to the (from their point of view) post-apocalyptic state of our universe, and not exactly pleased.\nZenith Onslaught\nis the second expansion for AI War 2, and was more than a year in the making. We focused on making the galaxy feel rich and complex and changeable in new ways, as well as adding a metric ton of general new content.\nMajor New Factions\nThe Dark Zenith can be set to invade at some point.  They then set up their own economy, allying with the Dark Spire if they are also enabled.  These can really make even the AI sweat.\nThe Zenith Architrave, fresh into our universe and desperate to get back to their own galaxy-spanning war.  Minor diplomacy may be possible.  (Think of these like a vastly more advanced version of the Dyson Spheres in the base game, in that they don't turn the entire galaxy on its head but can be exciting neighbors).\nThe Zenith Miner, which first sends out probes, and later tries to mine entire planets into pieces.  Has a special taste for Dyson Spheres.  Hack them for fun and profit.\nNew Ships En Masse\n15 new and elite ships, Cruisers, now seed the galaxy that can greatly enhance your fleet. These powerful ships are both extremely powerful in their own right but each possesses a special feature based on their weapon tech. Two of these can only found by stealing Zenith technology.\n11 new Outguard to recruit to humanity's side, each with their own unique contribution, from the Trojan Horse that hides in plain sight before releasing its hidden drone army to the Cornucopia that supercharges your metal generation when you need it the most.\n7 new defensive structures, such as the reactive dummy that attracts enemy fire and returns a portion back to the sender, and a reworking of the original to grant every weapon tech their own.\nAnd many new strikecraft, frigates, and stationkeepers to further expand humanity's arsenal!  As well as new variants of the base-game golems!\nOther Major Features\nNomad Planets make a triumphant return from the original AI War, with options for entire Nomad Galaxies.  And yes, you can still become death, destroyer of worlds.\nWormhole borers, dangerous tools in the hands of the AI that allow them to tunnel behind your defenses.\n10 devious new AI types.\n2 new map styles.",

    "description": "Includes the following DLC: AI War: The Zenith Remnant, AI War: Children of Neinzul, AI War: Light of the Spire, AI War: Ancient Shadows, AI War: Vengeance Of The Machine, and AI War: Destroyer of Worlds.\nSome of the most unique AI ever seen in the genre, set in procedurally-generated galaxies with 50,000+ ships in them. A unique blend of 4X and grand strategy thinking at the galaxy-map level with RTS mechanics and tactics at the planetary level.\nAI War: The Zenith Remnant\nEvery planet is a choice. Every choice has a consequence. The Zenith Remnant is the first expansion to Arcen Games' hit space-based indie RTS/4X hybrid, AI War: Fleet Command. This expansion includes a massive amount of new content that bring the galaxy to life in exciting ways. Capturables, special AI ships, and ancient alien artifacts litter the cosmos, making your choices as a player more varied than ever. Do you risk total war with the AI by capturing and rebuilding a massive golem? Do you procure defensive superweapons from Zenith traders?\nAI War: Children of Neinzul\nToday I am born, today I die. The Neinzul are an insectoid race of perpetual \"younglings\" that live for an extremely short span before dying and being superseded by fully-aware and vicious replacements. Their Enclaves form mini-collectives with their own personalities, goals, and desires. In this second expansion to AI War, players face off against the Neinzul minor factions, against new AI types in general, and enlist the help of the friendlier members of this new alien presence. Enclave Starships bring a long-awaited feature: mobile space docks. New map types and new capturables add more excitement. Optionally, Hybrid Hives bring a new type of AI logic to the game: these free agents are like a coordinated pack of velociraptors hunting you against the backdrop of the regular AI forces. For advanced players, the Hybrid Hives provide more cut-throat opposition than ever.\nAI War: Light of the Spire\nThe Spire are coming... Ravaged by their recent encounters with the same AIs that pushed humanity to the brink of extinction, the Spire are an alien race that have also been all but destroyed. However, while the AIs were successful in their surprise attack against the Spire, the Spire are far more powerful than even the AIs seem to have realized. The Zenith were broken-down and ancient when humanity encountered them, but the Spire were at the height of their deadly power until quite recently. Now the splintered remains of their race are regrouping, and entering the galaxy with a vengeance. Their attitude toward humanity, who spawned the AIs that harmed the Spire, is unclear. Proceed with caution.\nAI War: Ancient Shadows\nIntroducing Champions: These modular behemoths can be upgraded, gain EXP, and lend powerful aid to your main forces. But champions possess a unique power that sets them even further apart from other units: they can explore entirely new parts of the galaxy where the AI cannot reach. Splinter factions of humans, zenith, neinzul, and spire all dwell in those backwater nebulae. Some are hiding. Some are plotting. Some have gone totally insane. It is there, in the shadows, that your champion can find relics from the ancient race which constructed it. What power awaits? At what cost?\nAI War: Vengeance Of The Machine\nThe AI's gotten kind of upset. Somewhere along the way it decided you puny humans need more interesting ways to lose (or win, if you're one of those people, but who are we to judge). Vengeance of the Machine offers new tools to the player (like Core Turret Controllers) and a new frontal-confrontation victory condition (Showdown Devices), but focuses on enhancing the already-incredible variety of your main opponent: the AI. The possibilities grow exponentially with the addition of the new \"Dual Type AI\" system (ever wonder what a single AI player would be like with Thief AND Speed-Racer? Find out!), AI Planetary Subcommanders, and Dire Guardians. They say the best stories revolve around an awesome villain, and this expansion takes AI War's villainy to new heights.\nAI War: Destroyer of Worlds\nFrom the game-changing Nomad Planets to the mysterious Exodian Blade, \"Destroyer of Worlds\" brings a new level of devastation to the epic AI War universe. Dare you use weapons that threaten the structure of the galaxy itself?\nCopyright 2009-2014 Arcen Games, LLC",

    "game_title": "Airport CEO",
    "description": "Airport CEO\nis a tycoon and management game where you take the seat as a CEO of your own airport. You will build the airport’s infrastructure with everything from runways and taxiways, gates and aprons to constructing terminals with check-in, security, restaurants and shops. You will manage the business perspective of the airport by hiring employees and executives, making deals with airline companies and making sure that ends meet by keeping an eye on budget and resources.\nYou will have to cater to the passengers by keeping waiting time to a minimum, by having friendly and helpful staff around and by making passengers feel secure, keeping any potential incidents at bay; a happy passenger is a spending passenger. Hopefully you won’t run into any problems such as stressed out employee, equipment breakdowns or bad weather which can cause massive delays or even emergency landings. You will be held accountable when things go wrong and filthy rich when things go right.\nRunning an airport\nYour objective is to build and manage your airport to perfection by making strategic decisions, designing the optimal airport layout and ultimately making sure that your passengers and airlines are satisfied. You will need to build the entire airport from scratch including terminal foundations with floors, walls, doors and items as well as the airport infrastructure including runways, taxiways, aprons and other airport infrastructure. Everything in Airport CEO is deeply simulated and it is your job to make sure it all runs smoothly and with a positive bank account.\nAirlines\nAirlines and their travelers are an essential element of Airport CEO as they consist of the main source of your airport’s income. Signing contracts with airlines bring cash-flow and passengers to your airport which in term means opportunities for receiving different service fees, as well as passenger expenditures. Airlines come in different sizes and have different requirements on your airport and the services you offer, you are responsible for not only planning the flight schedule but also for meeting and maintaining the needs. Occasionally you will need to handle emergencies and delays due to bad weather or accidents in the area, all which will put your management skills to the test.\nPassengers\nPassengers in Airport CEO all have their unique personalities, needs, a background story and most importantly; a flight to catch (on time). Passengers are thoroughly simulated and their decisions, behaviors and opinions about your airport are affected by several factors. Passengers in Airport CEO, just as in real life, must wait in lines, check in, pass security and then entertain themselves until their flight is ready for boarding. Arriving passengers must find their way the baggage claim, get a hold of their bags and maybe pass a customs booth before getting on their airport transfer. Whether they’ll be able to actually catch their flight is up to you: Passengers might have a hard time finding their way around the airport so you build an information desk, passengers might get irritated because of the long security queue and waiting time so you extend its capacity, passengers might complain about the lack of fun things to do in the gate area so you build a duty-free shop or exclusive brand boutiques.\nEmployees\nEmployees are those you rely on to keep your airport running. Just as passengers they are simulated individuals who have a mind of their own. Employees have a number of different roles and it is your job to make sure that your airport has the right and necessary work force at any time. From passenger service agents, janitors, ramp agents and mechanics, security officers to administrators and executives. The more you expand your airport’s capacity and services, the more versatile and skilled your employees have to be. When employees interact with passengers, they’ll have to be skilled at managing people and stress resistant in order to avoid making mistakes or give bad customer service.\nFacilities and buildings\nAirports are complex mega-structures with a lot of different buildings and facilities. While a small airport might not need more than a simple grass runway and a terminal, as you grow your airport you will have to expand its facilities ranging from air control towers, larger aircraft stands and taxiways to fire, weather, catering or fuel stations. As your airport grows your terminal grows with it and you will have to make sure that it is equipped with the necessary facilities that passengers are expecting. Building a terminal in Airport CEO is highly customizable where you lay out its shape and interior such floor type, walls, windows and doors. Baggage needs to be processed and transported to the same flight as its owner and its all up to you to avoid bottlenecks and by designing the ultimate airport terminal.\nBeing a CEO\nData, data, data! As the acting CEO of your airport you need to be able to make difficult business decisions based on current operation. In Airport CEO you’re provided with multiple sources of information from which you can draw conclusions and manage your airport. As the CEO you will not only be responsible for the architecture of the airport but also for those working in it. Tired of planning every flight? Establish an informatics department and let an automated system do it for you! Tired of assessing the monthly budget balance? Hire a CFO which can help you cut cost and set prices. Best of luck!\nCopyright © 2022, Apoapsis Game Laboratories AB,\nAll rights reserved.",

    "description": "The Aérospatiale/BAC Concorde is a turbojet powered supersonic passenger airliner, developed during the 1960s and flown from 1969 until 2003. It's one of the most iconic aircraft ever developed due to its unique characteristics as a result of its supersonic capabilities, traveling at over twice the speed of sound (Mach 2.04, 1354 mph (or 2180 kph) at cruise altitude). Typically seating 92 to 128 passengers, the Concorde flew regular transatlantic flights between airports such as LHR (Heathrow Airport), JFK (John F. Kennedy International Airport), CDG (Charles de Gaulle Airport) and IAD (Dulles International Airport) as well as many other destinations.\nThe Tupolev Tu-144 is a Soviet supersonic passenger airliner and in fact the world's first such as its maiden voyage in 1968 occurred two months ahead of the Concorde. The Tu-144 conducted a total of 102 commercial flights (although only 55 carried passengers) between 1968 and 1999. At cruising altitude, the Tu-144 could reach speeds of 1400 mph (or 2200 kph) and was the first passenger airline to exceed Mach 2 in 1970.\nThe Concorde and Tu-144 is brought to life in Airport CEO complete with stunning, authentic and accurate graphics, high-quality audio recordings from the real-life original Concorde aircraft including jet engines and ambiance as well as glorious takeoff afterburners, animated canards and droop-snoots!\nDownloading this free DLC will add the Concorde to the default airlines Olympus Organization and Zoom! and the Tu-144 to the default airlines Stripe Air and Crown Airlines, all part of the base game.\nThe Concorde and Tu-144 can, just like any other aircraft in Airport CEO, be modded with custom liveries using the official MDK.\nCopyright © 2022, Apoapsis Game Laboratories AB,\nAll rights reserved.",

Defeat them and reap the rewards.\nPlay across three distinctly different modes: taking on (or creating your own) bespoke Missions; building a mighty empire in Conquest, or destroying your friends in Multiplayer matches online or via LAN.\nCopyright 2016 David Stark",

    "description": "In Heroes & Villains, you can recruit ship captains and city governors to your cause.\nCaptains improve your ships' performance, and can use their abilities to turn the tide of battle. You can outflank enemy ships, cripple engines, create smokescreens, and more. Some captains also have unnatural powers that let them control the weather, confuse your enemies, or even raise the dead.\nGovernors can be assigned to cities to reduce unrest and increase productivity. Some of them can also issue temporary edicts such as declaring martial law, hosting a masked ball, or using the citizens for gruesome experiments. Others can get rid of monsters or pirates for you. All for a price.\nCaptains and governors react to events and your actions. A peace-loving governor may quit if he sees you commit one too many war crimes, whereas a researcher can gain experience from dissecting the monsters you kill. As time goes on they can change - for better or worse - and a few of them can become famous enough to re-unite the warring city-states, providing a new path to victory.\nAs for your crew, assuming they don't get killed in battle, they can gain experience, especially if trained by a suitable commander.\nDesign and award medals to ships based on their experience level, giving them powerful boosts. Each medal tier only has a small number of medals, and the medals are permanently lost along with their ships, so make sure you keep your medal-bearing ships alive.\nFinally, your realm can become entangled in various incidents that require you to determine - or guess at - what your opponents will do. Are they willing to risk war over a trade dispute? Is that charming nobleman an asset or a spy? Is your governor's clever plan going to work? Are you willing to accept the help of heretics?\nThe character art is created by Samma van Klaarbergen, and the DLC features nine new pieces of music by Curtis Schweitzer.",

    "description": "'Tis said that long ago peace and tranquility covered the lands. Food and drink flowed freely, man and beast lived in peace, gold and silver abounded – it was the Golden Age of Akalabeth.\nMondain, second born of Wolfgang, a great king of old, wished to gain his brother's inheritance and so he used his great powers for evil, creating deep dungeons guarded by daemons and Balrogs. Now blood flowed freely in Akalabeth, and foul creatures soon came to roam near the surface. Mondain cast such sickness and pestilence upon Akalabeth, that both man and beast lived in constant fear. Thus was the Dark Age of Akalabeth.\nThere arose from the land a man, pure and just, to battle the Dark Lord. British, Champion of the White Light, did battle with Mondain deep within the labyrinth of dungeons, eventually driving him from Akalabeth forever. British of the White Light was proclaimed Lord British, Protector of Akalabeth. Alas, much damage had been suffered unto the lands. The Revival of Akalabest has begun.\n'Tis thy duty to rid Akalabeth of the foul creatures which infest it, whilst trying to stay alive!\nDeveloped in 1979, Akalabeth is the first game made by the legendary creator of the Ultima Series, Richard Garriot.\nDesigned by the teenage Garriot in Applesoft BASIC for the Apple II, Akalabeth is one of the earliest known examples of a computer role-playing game, and is considered by many to be \"Ultima 0.\"\nFeaturing 10 different monsters, procedurally generated dungeon crawling, and wire frame 3D graphics, Akalabeth was highly advanced for its time and is still widely regarded as one of the most historically significant RPGs ever created.",

    "description": "Akihabara. \"Akiba,\" for short.\nThis suburban Tokyo ward's seen it all, from Japan's post-war reconstruction to the economic bubblegum crisis of the '80s. Always on the cutting edge of progress, with a little something to offer even the most fetishistic of appetites, it was almost inevitable that this singular technocracy of indulgence would give birth to a whole new kind of appetite altogether.\nEnter, the “Synthisters” – vampires who prey upon the life energy of the town’s unsuspecting figurine-chasers, maid café connoisseurs and cosplayers. Those victimized by Synthisters take on the properties of their attackers while also withdrawing from society and becoming veritable shut-ins due to their newfound fatal weakness to sunlight.\nAKIBA’S TRIP tells the story of one such unfortunate soul: a young man named Nanashi who was lured into a trap by the promise of rare character goods and transformed into one of the walking undead. He, however, was spared the worst of his fate by the bloody kiss of a mysterious Synthister hunter named Shizuku. Together with the rest of his companions in an organization unofficially dubbed the “Akiba Freedom Fighters,” Nanashi and Shizuku must uncover the truth behind the Synthister plague and save Akiba from being overrun by violent, antisocial energy vampires.\nAnd of course, the best way to fight vampires is to strip them down to their skivvies so they melt in the noonday sun…\nKEY FEATURES\nFaithful Recreation of Japan’s Electronics Mecca\nLike a virtual tour of Tokyo’s Akihabara district, all major outdoor locations from the town have been painstakingly recreated, with over 130 real-life shops accurately represented.\nUnique and Customizable Brawler-Style Combat\nAnything can be a weapon, from baseball bats to comics to motherboards, and individual clothing items may be targeted, stripped and added to the player’s own inventory.\nSatirical Story with Divergent Paths and Multiple Endings\nPlaying off common anime and video game tropes for social satire, the player’s choices determine how the story progresses, leading to one of many unique endings.\nModern Day Setting Enhances Gameplay Options and Adds Pop Culture Feel\nThe in-game smartphone is used to check email, read comments on “Pitter,” take side quests, catalog ad flyers, launch apps to identify the undead and much, much more.\n*Please note that the buildings and monuments depicted in the game AKIBA'S TRIP are based on the Akihabara town area from the fall of 2012 through the summer of 2013.*\n©2013-2015 ACQUIRE Corp.

Set in a rich fantasy world, resembling the darkest period of the Middle Ages, the game offers fast-paced action with a deep narrative.\nMaster a unique, hardcore combat system\nCustomize your character by choosing different Ways of Power, classes and skills\nExplore, craft, gain reputation and unlock new quests\nChoose one of 4 playable races (Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Orcs), 40+ houses and clans to fight for, each with their own history. Start your own legacy in The Four Kingdoms after the first playthrough\n12 memorable companions with their own backstories, ready to join or fight you during your journey\nAlaloth is a dark god who turned on his pantheon and came to the mortal realms. There he lies imprisoned in the Valley of Storms, where the four great kingdoms of humans, orcs, elves, and dwarves intersect. From the Valley’s heart, he spreads evil throughout the kingdoms, determined to extinguish any light of hope for all who call this world home.\nStorms, monsters, plagues, strife, and great dragons beset the land – it will require strength and courage to defeat Alaloth in his prison.\nThe world of Alaloth is comprised of four vast territories. To the northwest lies The Goldwood Forest and The Republic of Larastir with elves keeping the secrets of the gods safe. To the northeast are the mountains named The Fangs of Kemot, home to dwarves that inhabit this great rocky territory: Karak-Hohn. To the southwest, you will discover the wastelands, the Desolation of Baga, where orcs rule. In the southeast humans brought civilization to an age of gold with a huge bay area of cities, merchants, and prosperous growth: The Blessed Kingdom of Edherest.\nA hardcore combat system is combined with a brand new isometric gameplay, featuring spectacular moves in challenging fights with various enemies. You have to carefully plan the next move. One reckless action and you die.\nCustomize your warrior by choosing from among three different Ways of Power - Arms, Gods, Nature - each one with three different professions to choose from.

Or will you spend your time fishing for a legendary lunker?\nNo two routes play exactly the same, and you can take on whichever you want—or even all of them at once—while also completing optional quests for a variety of townsfolk.\nMultiple Ways to Play\nNo two main quests play the same. You can enjoy a traditional turn-based RPG or complete quests that involve no combat at all.\nMercenaries for Hire\nIf you choose to challenge the game's dungeons, you can hire your choice of four mercenaries to go along with you. Each one has her own unique talents, so you can enjoy building a party of two that suits your combat style!\nPacifist Routes\nSeveral of the game's main quests focus on different kinds of gathering, and thus can be completed without ever seeing a battle screen. If you like to relax with a fishing rod or a pickaxe in hand, Alchemist Quest has you covered!\nThe Tower of Ordeals\nFor those who love a challenge, there's a gauntlet of brutal post-game battles waiting to test your mettle after the credits roll!\nThis Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages or may not be appropriate for viewing at work.\n© Kagura Games and ShiroKuroSoft, All Rights Reserved.",

This is where you've probably realized that this game has multiple endings. There are numerous major choices to be made, a story that repeats itself, and the true goals of the characters to be revealed. An adventure the likes of which you've never experienced before is about to begin!\nBattle Action\nOne of the core points of this game is its stylish, tag-team battle system!\nSwing Usada’s giant hammer to pulverize your enemies with powerful melee attacks, or use Kotora’s submachine gun and bombs to take out enemies from a distance. Switch between the two to chain impressive combos! Chaining combos will increase their attack power, and make it easier to quickly defeat your many oncoming enemies.\nTaking out enemies builds up your Chance Gauge, which can be used to perform supporting attacks and devastating ultimate attacks. (Feature not included in the demo.)\nThe intensity builds in boss fights: whittle down their Shield Gauge to break their shields, letting you unleash a flurry of attacks. But beware: they've got a variety of powerful attacks to hit you back with!\nOur heroines learn and grow\nWhen you collect the skill crystals that drop all over the world, you can improve your characters' skills. You can improve their weapons, which will then unlock unique skills. Or you can focus on their stats and movement, and even pick up skills to help them convince others to help them. If you find yourself stuck on a difficult boss, then try taking some time away from the main path to help our heroes grow stronger.\nScattered about here and there in the world are death matches (areas where you can't proceed without defeating all of the enemies there), and if you can finish them with a high-count combo, or without taking any damage, you can earn skill crystal fragments.\nIn addition, out in the world you can also find Heart Crystals, which increase your heroes' maximum health, in addition to other key items that they'll need on their adventure. Based on what you find, you might find that they're protected by powerful traps, just like the treasure you'd find deep inside of a cave.  Go explore any way you wish in the world of Alice in Wonderland!\nCharacters\nUsamura-san\nA strange, white rabbit that seems to be really busy for some reason. It looks like there's a zipper on his back...? He's also looking for Alice.\nCheshire Cat\nA cryptic feline who appears before Usada and Kotora and enjoys testing her skills against them. Perhaps she has another goal aside from just getting in their way...?\nMad Hatter\nA dignified lady who holds a tea party practically every day. Beloved by the denizens of Wonderland. It looks like she lost something important recently.\nAlice\nThe person that Usada, Kotora, and Usamura-san are searching for. Just where in the world did she go? The Mad Hatter and the others might know something about that.\nStory\nOne summer's day, Usada and Kotora go to the library to do their homework. While Kotora takes her studies seriously, Usada has her head in the clouds. She wanders over to a bookshed deep inside, returning with a big, thick book.\n\"I found this interesting-looking book!\"\nKotora looks back at her quizzically. Suddenly, a slip of paper falls out from the book. The letter reads:\n\"Find Alice.\"\nAs soon as they read the words, the two are enveloped in a blinding light. When they come to, they're in a grassy field that they've never seen before. At that moment, a white rabbit comes hopping along. He might know how to get back to their own world!\nThe pair take their first steps into the world of this magical book, in order to go searching for the white rabbit...\nFeatures\nCharacter illustrations by the talented PicPicGram\nDeveloped by illuCalab\nTwo playable characters\nTwo difficulties to choose from",

    "description": "During the first half of the 21st century, the war on terror became a global phenomenon, as more blatant and frenzied attacks struck deeper into the lives of common people. Inevitably, the public outcry to stop the madness grew to an irresistible level; the military forces of the world slowly but steadily retooled their approach, weapons, and tactics to combat people who were willing to die for their cause. One of the consequences was the harassment of civilians on an unprecedented scale, leaving destruction and misery in its wake.\nThe world was soon rebuilt and a new age of prosperity and technological progress began. Science focused on creating a viable fusion power source and new technologies which would exploit this new power. A group of corporations was granted almost total freedom in order to pursue these goals. This may have seemed dangerous a hundred years ago, but in 2112 it was considered appropriate and was supposed to foster creativity and growth on an unprecedented scale.It didn't.\nComplete the single-player campaign or hold out as long as you can in the ultra-challenging Survival mode. Obliterate aliens with a massive arsenal of upgradable weapons. Customise your character and enjoy the ultimate alien-slaughtering experience!\n© 2003 - 2009 Sigma Team. All Rights Reserved",

    "description": "In the far future, the last of humanity's great Empires sits on the brink of collapse. The great noble houses fight amongst themselves as they seek their own enrichment while the people of the Empire struggle to make ends meet. Amidst all the political tension, your predecessor has passed away, and you have ascended to the throne.\nIn Alliance of the Sacred Suns, you play as the young Emperor of an interstellar Empire riddled with social, political, and economic issues. As a blend of grand-strategy and RPG, you will make decisions that influence the future of the realm while managing your court, your relationships with the great nobles of the Empire, and your own well-being.\nAs a young Emperor taking the throne, you have your whole life ahead of you to return the realm to its once-glorious state. Be wary of separatists who seek to undermine you, and those who do not respect your title. Many are willing to bring a quick end to your reign by any means necessary to further their own agendas.\nCreate your own ruler's background to determine who you are, how you were raised, and what you do best. The house you hail from, your culture, and your capabilities will determine how you navigate the challenges of your reign.\nAlliance of the Sacred Suns will see your character age over time with their health either declining or improving based on events that take place, and depending on how actively they rule. Each turn will have a limited number of action points, and while you'll often want to spend them all to make sweeping moves, saving some action points in a turn will allow your health to improve as you take on less stress.\nThe Projects you take on as Emperor will help shape who you are beyond your upbringing - will you pursue only the most honorable of projects, or will you occasionally take on Projects with questionable ethics for the greater good? Balance the Honor, Humanity, and Piety of your actions accordingly.\nManaging your physical health and mental well-being is as crucial as passing decrees and sending orders to your governors and fleets. Should you die, you do not continue as your heirs - you have but one lifetime to lead, and just the one lifetime with which to save the Empire.\nThe Empire has been in decline for generations as you take the throne - the formation of the Great Houses and their growing strength has come at the expense of the throne's centralized authority. The nobles know where they stand in this hierarchy, and though there is a degree of respect for your office, many will use what they have as leverage against their Emperor.\nMaintain relationships with leaders of the five other Great Houses of the Empire to ensure their continued support of the throne. The better their opinion of you, the more they will be willing to contribute in resources and taxes.\nThe Great Houses are not one congruent entity - they have their own quarrels and internal politics. This means your relations with one will have an impact on your relations with another, and you will need to balance which of the Great Houses are most important. The resources they are able to provide you and their relative military and political strength are essential factors in choosing your closest political allies.\nManage your high-level advisors, determine the budget they have to work with, and ensure you are maximizing your benefits from each of their offices while also using them as tokens for relations with the Great Houses. A more capable Finance Prime will be able to wring more taxes out of the Great Houses, while a more capable Science Prime will assist in the technological advancement of the Empire. Poor assignments in any of the offices of the Five Primes can lead to troubles instead.\nAll levels of governance are, to varying degrees, under your control. From the aforementioned Primes to the planetary Viceroys, each assignment will have rippling consequences. Take note of a character's strengths and weaknesses as you make them Viceroy - assign them appropriate planets to govern to maximize their output while managing your finely balanced relations with the Houses.\nWhether interacting with leaders of the Great Houses, your own family, or citizens of the Empire, you will have many opportunities to define the kind of sovereign you are.\nJust as you can engage in politics with members of the Great Houses, they can be the ones to initiate said politicking themselves. You will often see requests for an audience, or at times demands, and whether you decide to entertain or ignore such overtures will have repercussions for your reign.\nManaging how you spend your efforts and action points each turn will mean you often have to ignore certain requests to make room for others - planning ahead around such circumstances will be vital to maintaining the integrity of the Empire, and your relationships with the Great Houses.\nAs time passes between turns, various events at court will see you make decisions that further define you as an individual and your Empire alike. Will you allow healthcare on a specific planet to fall to the black market at the cost of their opinion of you? Will you offer financial support to every Great House that comes begging, just to appease them?\nYour Empire cannot remain stagnant, even as it decays from the inside. You must project strength in a variety of ways, for vultures are always in the skies above.\nUse Projects to determine where the Empire's resources are spent, helping the Great Houses improve their holdings in a way that ultimately improves their contribution to the throne. But be careful - projects that help one Great House over another will have an impact on your relations, and while assigning members of a specific house to a project is a great way to quickly improve relations, you're just as likely to sour relations with their rival houses, potentially upsetting the balance that keeps the Great Houses in check.\nExplore neighboring star systems and seek opportunities for expansion and exploitation - some stars are more likely to be surrounded by habitable planets while others are more likely to provide resources of various kinds. Whichever you pursue, make sure you have the resources to do so - materials, operational output, and fleets alike will need to be balanced between the various ways in which you can assert control and show your strength to the Great Houses.\nAlliance of the Sacred Suns is built to support modding. Players can access much of the game mechanics and content through text and XML editing. We are excited to see what worlds modders will create using our politics-in-space framework.",

    "description": "Alone in the Dark weaves a chilling tapestry of psychological horror and Southern Gothic charm, reimagining the iconic game that set the benchmark for the genre. We invite you to join us on a journey into madness, where each encounter could be your last. With each step you take closer to unravelling Derceto's mystery, the eyes that watch from the darkness grow hungrier. Every bullet means the difference between survival and an unthinkable end. The next door you unlock could lead to a nightmarish realm offering nothing but slashing claws, grasping tentacles, and frayed sanity.  Journey to interbellum Louisiana, where an era of decadence hides a darker tale - of escape from past traumas and an intolerant society, into the waiting grasp of something darker, something that has patiently lurked for impossible eons. This is Alone in the Dark as you've never seen it - a skillfully-woven narrative of Southern Gothic elegance and eldritch madness that pays homage to its legendary origins while taking the next step forward in survival horror storytelling.\nA Haunting Tale of Mystery and Madness\nStep inside Derceto Manor, an asylum shrouded in intrigue, guarding a terrible secret. Client Emily Hartwood and private investigator Edward Carnby embark on a harrowing quest for answers; Emily to the mystery of her missing uncle, Edward to the toughest case he will ever face, and both to questions they dare not ask themselves. This re-envisioned classic invites you to explore an unforgettable single player adventure rich with suspense, frights, and revelations that will test the limits of your imagination.\nFeaturing Hollywood Talent\nExperience some of the greatest acting survival horror has ever seen through the performances of award-winning actors Jodie Comer (Killing Eve, Free Guy) and David Harbour (Stranger Things, Black Widow) in their first videogame roles. Jodie and David’s immaculately captured likenesses breathe life into Emily Hartwood and Edward Carnby, lending a deeply personal aspect to Alone in the Dark’s story that demands it be played twice to get the full experience.\nA Tribute to Horror Pioneers\nRediscover the essence of psychological horror in a game that respectfully nods to its 1992 origin, the game that established the survival horror genre. Alone in the Dark is your gateway to an experience steeped in the atmospheric dread of classic horror, with next-generation storytelling and gameplay. A must-play for fans of twisted tales, nerve-wracking exploration, and desperate combat.\nA Story That Challenges Reality\nEnvisioned by Mikael Hedberg, acclaimed writer behind modern horror classics “SOMA” and “Amnesia”, Alone in the Dark’s intricate web of mystery delves into themes of trauma, faith, evil, and abandonment. Whether you choose to brave the nightmare as Emily or Edward, you will uncover secrets that defy everything you thought about videogame storytelling.\nExplore Derceto Manor in this reimagination of Alone in the Dark, a love letter to the 90’s cult classic horror game.\nReturn to the roots of psychological horror and experience an atmospheric journey worthy of the game that started the genre.\nDive into a world full of sounds that make your skin crawl with a haunting, yet mesmerizing doom jazz soundtrack.\nEnjoy the thrill of desperate survival in a world where reality starts to crumble, evil lurks in every shadow and ammunition is scarce.\nExperience this nightmare from either Emily Hartwood’s or Edward Carnby’s perspective and unearth the dark secrets of a gothic mansion.\nImmerse yourself in a deep psychological story that goes beyond the realms of the imaginable, by Mikael Hedberg, cult horror writer of SOMA and Amnesia.\nSee Emily and Edward brought to live by the Hollywood talent of Jodie Comer (Killing Eve, Free Guy) and David Harbour (Stranger Things, Black Widow), who lend their voices, their appearance, and their formidable acting skills to the protagonists.\n© 2024 THQ Nordic AB, Sweden.

Hailing from the rat race of urban society, he half-expects another uphill challenge in a new battlefield.\n...But nothing could be further from the truth.\nRight from day one, he is befriended by new classmates and quickly learns to sit back and enjoy life―all while getting to know three very different girls who inspire in him another kind of sea change.\nThere’s Kazuha, the taciturn daughter of the family that takes him in, who’s lowkey the perfect host...\nKogane, the always sunny, high-energy first-year he meets through a sudden and dramatic encounter...\nAnd Yashiro, a shrine-maiden third-year with a silly streak, who’s like nothing out of this world...\nHere Haruto’s friendships and romance will interweave as a unique student love story unfolds. Over one dazzling summer, one girl’s affections will bloom from nascent butterflies into deepest love.\nCHARACTERS\nKazuha Ainokura\nYukari Aoyama\nA second-year student like Haruto and the daughter of relatives on his mother’s side. She has a strong-willed personality and can be a bit stubborn, often displaying a tough exterior.\nTheir relationship starts off somewhat awkwardly due to initial misunderstandings and having to live under the same roof. However, she has a fundamentally caring nature, often looking out for him, especially considering his recent move as a newcomer.\nKogane Amahara\nHana Akino\nA girl one year below Haruto who gets along with everyone but never really seems to let people in. For better or worse, the distance she keeps only adds to her idol-like appeal and has won her plenty of male and female fans alike.\nAlways the type to enthusiastically join in on anything fun, showcasing excellent athletic prowess and even helping out at various school clubs. Her inclusive and easygoing nature allows her to engage in playful banter with just about anyone she meets.\nYashiro Kaminashi\nRoro Amari\nA girl who’s one year above Haruto and also a priestess at the Nanakayama Shrine. Her distinct sensibilities often see her spending time alone, although many of her male classmates are enchanted by her good looks and cool demeanor.\nThough she doesn’t express her emotions too openly, at heart, she cares for all those around her. Forever a daydreamer, she can sometimes be slow to catch on.\nThis Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages or may not be appropriate for viewing at work.\nBuying this game on GOG you will receive a censored version of the game.",

    "description": "UNRATED DLC brings additional adult content to the game.\nGAMEPLAY & FEATURES\nMulti-choice, single-ending VN with 5 hours till credits\nStar-studded cast of professional Japanese voice talent\nSTORY\nHaruto leaves the big city for a coastal town surrounded by blue sea and deep-green mountains. Hailing from the rat race of urban society, he half-expects another uphill challenge in a new battlefield.\n...But nothing could be further from the truth.\nRight from day one, he is befriended by new classmates and quickly learns to sit back and enjoy life―all while getting to know three very different girls who inspire in him another kind of sea change.\nThere’s Kazuha, the taciturn daughter of the family that takes him in, who’s lowkey the perfect host...\nKogane, the always sunny, high-energy first-year he meets through a sudden and dramatic encounter...\nAnd Yashiro, a shrine-maiden third-year with a silly streak, who’s like nothing out of this world...\nHere Haruto’s friendships and romance will interweave as a unique student love story unfolds. Over one dazzling summer, one girl’s affections will bloom from nascent butterflies into deepest love.\nCHARACTERS\nKazuha Ainokura\nYukari Aoyama\nA second-year student like Haruto and the daughter of relatives on his mother’s side. She has a strong-willed personality and can be a bit stubborn, often displaying a tough exterior.\nTheir relationship starts off somewhat awkwardly due to initial misunderstandings and having to live under the same roof. However, she has a fundamentally caring nature, often looking out for him, especially considering his recent move as a newcomer.\nKogane Amahara\nHana Akino\nA girl one year below Haruto who gets along with everyone but never really seems to let people in. For better or worse, the distance she keeps only adds to her idol-like appeal and has won her plenty of male and female fans alike.\nAlways the type to enthusiastically join in on anything fun, showcasing excellent athletic prowess and even helping out at various school clubs. Her inclusive and easygoing nature allows her to engage in playful banter with just about anyone she meets.\nYashiro Kaminashi\nRoro Amari\nA girl who’s one year above Haruto and also a priestess at the Nanakayama Shrine. Her distinct sensibilities often see her spending time alone, although many of her male classmates are enchanted by her good looks and cool demeanor.\nThough she doesn’t express her emotions too openly, at heart, she cares for all those around her. Forever a daydreamer, she can sometimes be slow to catch on.\nThis Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages or may not be appropriate for viewing at work.",

    "description": "In a world of myth and magic, those who aspire to immortality devote their lives to the sacred path of cultivation. They gather around sects, institutions which train their bodies, minds and souls to be worth eternal life. But in return for such great power, you must be willing to guard the balance between good and evil -- no matter the cost.\nUnfortunately, greed is inherent to human nature, so it also blinds cultivators. Your master didn’t realize until it was too late, and the Taiyi Sect burnt to the ground for his mistake. Your brothers and sisters will never come back, but the Taiyi Sect can still be reborn from its ashes. Its seeds are scattered around Tiancang, waiting for you to find them. This is what your grandmaster would have wanted. You must do it for him ─ and for all those we sworn to protect.\nSet in the fictional Tiancang era, Amazing Cultivation Simulator brings to you the magic of Asian mythology through a strategy game with strong xianxia nuances, a Chinese literary genre which is deeply influenced by Taoist and Buddhist concepts, as well as folklore and traditional knowledge on medicine and martial arts. Its gameplay is inspired by famous games like Rimworld and Dwarf Fortress, as well as The Legend of Shushan Swordsman and Martial Kingdoms.\nAs a grandmaster, you’ll bring the Taiyi Sect back to its glory days by training new apprentices, gathering knowledge and expand your domain through commerce and political alliances to gain influence over other sects. Also, you must protect people from supernatural dangers such as bad spirits, monsters and enchanted artifacts.\nKEY FEATURES\nDesign your own Cultivation sect\nfrom scratch until it becomes a huge spiritual center.\nManage your school and students\nso they are happy and productive for you.\nExpand your domain\ns and meet new allies to become more powerful than other sects.\nCommerce and interact with other NPCs\n, but be careful – your actions will impact their behavior!\nKeep the balance\nbetween good and evil.\nResearch and fill your library\nwith more and more sources of mystic knowledge, martial arts, medicine…\nSearch for the most powerful relics\nand artifacts.\nHunt evil beasts and demons\nthat want to destroy the world you want to protect.\nLive\nunique playthroughs every time\n: maps are randomly generated for each run.\nLearn about\nChinese myths and legends\n, as well as spiritual traditions which draw from Taoism and Buddhism.\nUpdate\nYaoguai Awakening: As Qi energies resurge across the lands, the Yaoguai finally return to the mortal realm. Enlightened beasts start cultivation of their own, craving a longer life, but they still can't escape the Creed of Heaven or the Heavenly Tribulation.\nTaoist Animism: Even the most base of existences have the chance to attain spirituality as they subsist throughout the mists of time. If fortunate enough, some might even be enlightened by a master and turned into sentient spirits. After acquiring a human body through Body Genesis, they are all set to begin their cultivation.\nPhysical Cultivation: Ancient Yaoguai never bothered to become enlightened or to meditate on the Creed of Heaven. They domineered the realm with their brutal physical strength. They follow their instincts and burn their own vital energy to refine their bodies with nature's essence, until they can even block flying swords and survive the Heavenly Tribulation with mere mortal bodies.\nPet Training: Spiritual pets are special creatures with mighty forms and profound potential. They are also manifestations of the rules of nature. Learn to train your sect's pet, and have them serve your needs.\nMore Plotlines: As the ancient Yaoguai return, the realm of cultivators will witness an unprecedented upheaval that shall spare no creature. But is it a blessing or a curse?\nUpdated Tutorial: In the Yaoguai Uprising update, we made a complete, step-by-step tutorial to help new players learn all the controls and game systems so that everyone can experience the fun of cultivation.\nEncyclopedia: All kinds of items, laws and monsters are recorded here. You can reflect on your journey and also anticipate new adventures.\nBeast Siege: The Phoenix, Jiao-dragon and Torch Dragon have all awoken. Threatened by the invasion of the three mighty ancient beasts, will your sect be able to survive the trials that await?\nRoaming Sages: To hunt ancient beasts, one must become a true cultivation champion. Myriad mysterious sages from different sects start roaming the world far and wide. To your sect, this shall be both an opportunity and a brand-new challenge.\nElemental Medicines: The planting methods of dozens of powerful elemental herbs have been found. A storeroom full of potent elemental medicines is a dream no longer!\nBuilding Rotation: Build your sect as you like.\nAnimal Farming: You can now feed paralyzed animals, using their favorite food as bait to try and tame them.\nFeng Shui Relic: Regular items may have stats that make them a Feng Shui Relic.\nExplore the World: Almost the entire world is yours to explore.

Sub-spirits can help cultivators with Primordial Spirits make great progress in their practice.\nVarious Tribulations: Once their attainment and lifespan limits are reached, cultivators can take on the corresponding Heavenly Tribulations to break through and earn themselves new realms of progress.\nCultivation Laws: Thousands of laws have been discovered in the realm of cultivators, each law worth studying and learning if only for its uniqueness alone.

    "description": "In the world of immortality seekers, a great event has unfolded: an ancient, out-of-this-world land named the Great Bamboo Forest has been discovered by some especially adventurous cultivators. It’s a land full of new resources: gather tasty bamboo shoots for cooking, and cut down bamboo stalks to construct buildings of various styles, or to make fishing rods! And don’t forget the cute, mysterious creatures that lurk within: the pandas!\nWitness the panda's charm for yourself as it sweeps across the world of cultivators!\nNew animal species: Panda\nA newly-discovered creature—the panda, native to the Great Bamboo Forest. Nurture them, and fill your sect with their cuteness.\nYet sometimes, panda monsters who have failed in their shapeshift may invade your sect.\nPandas that have become enlightened transform into Panda Yaoguai. They are blessed with traits unique to their species, and can unlock secret bodies exclusive to them if they become physical cultivators.\nNew Spiritual Pets: Divine Panda Brothers\nXiuxiu and Xianxian are brothers. Xiuxiu transferred his own life force to save his brother, who was born disabled, preventing his mind and body from growing on its own. This sacrifice also resulted in the two sharing a curious symbiotic connection.\nThe Divine Panda Brothers are natural diplomats. Sending them to any NPC sect will rapidly improve your relationship with them.\nYou can now invite them to your sect, and watch them grow as your sect develops and expands.\nNew Plant: Bamboo\nAdded a new plant that can be grown and harvested: bamboo. You can now collect bamboo stalks and bamboo shoots (the love of every panda!) from them.\nAdded food and dishes that incorporate bamboo shoots.\nAdded new buildings constructed from bamboo stalks.\nNew System: Fishing\nYou can now catch fish in bodies of water all across the world. In this world of immortality, there’s countless strange and wonderful fish each with vastly different habits; figuring out how to catch them all can now become a joy for every inquisitive cultivator. And you’ll be able to catch a whole lot more than just fish… This is the world of cultivators, after all!\nAdded 64 different fish species.\nAdded food and dishes incorporating fish.",

    "description": "The first collaboration content of Amazing Cultivation Simulator is now available! This time, we're releasing a new DLC — Immortal tales of Wudang, in collaboration with the Wudang Museum and the home to many Taoist temples: the Wudang Mountains.\nSomething bizarre occurred in the world of immortals: An immortal mountain appeared out of nowhere.\nRumor says that an immortal is sitting on the peak of the mountain, fishing above the sea of clouds.\nThe word 'Wudang' is vaguely visible from a distance. It's even said that the mountain is where the Perfected Warrior Emperor once practiced in the world of mortals.\nMany have climbed the mountain, hoping that they would see immortals from the legends and even learn skills from them. However, immortals are rare to find, and only those fortunate enough are able to meet one.\nA New Law: Law of Nimbus Conquest\nIt is a supreme law created by the Perfected Warrior, which is created by Yin and Yang, can be powerful if you can handle its special mechanism.\nNew Wudang Spirit Pet: Black Tortoise Miao\nAs one of the four Chinese traditional monsters, the black tortoise has an indissoluble bond with the Wudang Mountain. The move and silence state of the turtle snake is the same as Yin Yang Taiji, which is an essential part of the Wudang Culture from ancient time.\nBlack Tortoise Miao is a descendant of the Perfected Warrior Emperor's mount. Yin and Yang exist together in harmony inside it, and its Core can also be split into two. Black Tortoise thus excels at both defense and offense\n.\nNew Items\nSoil Essence\nNew Drugs\nTrimerous Essence Pill\nQi Fasting Pill\nNew Equipment\nFly-Whisk\nSword of Tao\nSacred Nimbus Plate\nNew Treasure Artifacts\nPerfected Warrior Sword\nPurple Cloud Measure\nNew Fishes\nCloud Ee\nNight Carp\nGolden Claw\nNew Sect: Wudang Mountain\nWudang Mountain is a famous Taoist Holy Land in China. It has had the holy names of \"Taiyue\", \"xuanyue\" and \"Da Yue\" since ancient times. It is also the human Taoist field of the Perfected Warrior emperor. It is known as an \"unparalleled scenic spot in ancient times and the first fairy mountain in the world\". There are too many stories about the reputation of Wudang Mountain, but there is no doubt that Wudang Mountain and its Taoist culture constitute the most important chapter in Chinese traditional culture. Now, the immortal gate of Wudang, which has been hidden for many years in the immortal cultivation world, has finally unveiled its mystery.\nOn the East Sea, a lofty, hazy mountain of immortals suddenly appeared in the mortal world. Cultivators explored the place and found that it's a long-lost, boundless realm of immortals, and hidden within is a seclusive Taoist sect! The Taoist teachings of the sect are directly passed down from the Perfected Warrior. Its disciples have all mastered the essence of Tao and excel at expelling demons. The realm is known as the Wudang Mountains!\nNew Wudang Places\nGolden Peak\nReattainment Temple\nPurple Cloud Palace\nSouthrock Palace\nImmortal Land Scenery\nIn the process of making these new scenes, we took the most famous scenic spots of Wudang Mountain as the prototype and re-engraved the beautiful fairyland scenery of Wudang Mountain into the game, such as the Golden Hall of Wudang Golden Peak, the sea of clouds, the Zigzag Yellow River wall of the Reattainment Temple, the cliffs of the Southrock Palace, dragon incense, the Bixi Memorial Stele of Zixiao palace, etc... the scenery in the game is not as good as that of Wudang fairyland, Players are also welcome to visit the holy land of Wudang and mark on your own!\nGolden Hall of the Golden Peak\nThe Sea Cloud of the Golden Peak\nZigzag Yellow River Wall of the Reattainment Temple\nDragon Incense\nTaoist Pagoda\nPinetree Forest of the Purple Cloud Palace\nPerfected Warrior Emperor Statue\nSacred Nimbus Plate\nNew Map Adventures\nDragon Incense Worship\nCrown Princess Study Hall\nPurple Cloud Palace\nPurple Cloud Palace Destiny\n21 New Wudang Buildings\nGolden Hall\nDragon Incense\nPerfected Warrior Emperor Statue\nBixi Memorial Stele\nIncense Cauldron\nTaoist Pagoda\nTaichi Drum\nWudang Gate\nBlack Phoenix Screen\nWudang Banner\nDragon Censer\nTrigrams Cushion\nGruidae Lantern\nSacred Nimbus Plate\nBlack Tortoise Lantern\nCloudpeak Tea Plant x2\nWudang Pine Tree\nNew Walls: the Curved Walls\nSpecial curved walls in Wudang. There is a big and a small set of walls, and players can build them freely. The small set of walls can make rooms, while the big one cannot but be a kind of moderation, making the sect looks more beautiful and dignified.",

    "description": "A revolutionary, romantic, visual novel where your choices change the course of history!\nIt’s March 19th, 1789 and King Louis XVI rules over France from the gilded halls of Versailles. France is a country of elegance and poverty, of ancient tradition and unstoppable change. It is a country on the brink of revolution.\nAttend parties, mingle with the rich and powerful, learn their secrets, and use this to get the wealth and power you deserve. Find true love in an opulent world of ever-shifting alliances, that grows more dangerous by the day.\nStill, you must always keep your eye on the coming revolution. After all, it’s better to be on the right side of history, than the wrong side of the guillotine.\nExplore A Living, Scheming World\nUse your calendar to plan your commitments each week in Paris, and more importantly, who you do them with. In a city marching towards revolution, time is of the essence, and your enemies have agendas of their own!\nLove Is Power\nEnsnare the hearts of Parisian nobles and use their influence to your advantage. Change the outcome of political events, snub your rivals, and be lavished with expensive gifts.\nEverything Has A Price\nTurn gossip into profit by selling the secrets you learn, but be careful! Your own credibility and security are also at stake. The choices you make can yield great rewards and change the course of the story, but dire consequences could arise if you’re caught!\nA Cast Of Unforgettable Characters\nFall in love with a sprawling cast of fully realized characters. Enjoy the company and learn the secret histories of mysterious priests, wronged soldiers, wealthy widows, and more! Don’t worry, if you’re discreet, you won’t have to pick just one.\nAn Exquisite Work Of Art\nExperience a gorgeously illustrated, and lovingly researched rendition of 18th century Paris. It is a time of fashion, and a time of secrecy. It is a world of staggering beauty, and unspeakable danger.\nThe Sound Of Another Time\nBe entranced by the authentic, original score crafted by award-winning composer John Robert Matz! Enjoy a sweeping musical journey that will take you from the class and sophistication of fashionable string quartets, to the grandeur of the orchestra of the late baroque.\nAmbition: A Minuet in Power © 2017-2021 Joy Manufacturing Co.

    "description": "American Conquest:\nIn the year 1492, travel to America as Christopher Columbus and ignite the fire that will fan 300 years of heated battles for land, riches, and freedom. In eight historical campaigns spanning 42 missions, you will take on the roles of great legends such as Francisco Pizarro and George Washington. Secure new technologies, unique weaponry, and improved fighting units, but also master the delicate world of diplomacy. Play with fire! Conquer America!\nAmerican Conquest Fight Back:\nThree centuries of war continue with frantic combat and desperate power struggles raging across the American continent. The Spanish press the attack in the Yucatan against the fierce Maya and Aztec nations. The Germans put all their efforts into finding the legendary El Dorado. The Pontiac Uprising ends in a terrifying bloodbath between Native Americans and the British. And the Russians will do anything to conquer Alaska at the cost of the Haida. Lead armies of thousands of troops to victory in large-scale battles in 10 missions.\nBoth games are a real treat for any strategy fan. But this is not a standard RTS, there is no simple build-send-and-forget here because even the biggest army can be defeated by a well coordinated, but relatively small force. Just like the old proverb says: “An army of sheep led by a lion would defeat an army of lions led by a sheep.”\nWage historical wars on an epic scale, with over 16.000 units on gigantic battlefields.\n12 nations to choose from, each with its own unique set of units, buildings, technologies, and abilities.\nExtensive battle mechanics that feature economical and political dependencies, unit formations, and tactical maneuvers.\nNote: This game may require additional serial key for multiplayer mode. In order to receive one, please reach out to our\nSupport team\n.",

    "description": "The Swine are Rising!\nIn 2010 Frictional Games terrified the world with the cult horror Amnesia: A Dark Descent. Now they bring you a new nightmare. Created in collaboration with The Chinese Room, the studio behind Dear Esther, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is an intense and terrifying journey into the heart of darkness\nthat lurks within us all.\nThe year is 1899\nWealthy industrialist Oswald Mandus awakes in his bed, wracked with fever and haunted by dreams\nof a dark and hellish engine. Tortured by visions of a disastrous expedition to Mexico, broken on the\nfailing dreams of an industrial utopia, wracked with guilt and tropical disease, he wakes into a\nnightmare. The house is silent, the ground beneath him shaking at the will of some infernal machine:\nall he knows is that his children are in grave peril, and it is up to him to save them.\nStep back into the horror\nLike The Dark Descent, this is a game driven by its story, exploration of the world and the constant\nfear of the unknown. You can expect classic Amnesia gameplay, physics interaction and the\nsignature blend of high-end gaming with low system requirements.\nThink you understand fear? Think again.\nA Machine for Pigs takes both the world of Amnesia and the technology of The Dark Descent to new\nheights of horror. Built using an updated version of HPL2 engine, the game features stunning visual\nand environment design, incredible music and audio effects and adapted artificial intelligence. These\nare all driven by a gut-wrenching, blood-curdling new story, set sixty years after the events of the\noriginal game.\nUnique game created in collaboration between two independent game companies famous for exploring the outer reaches of what games can be. Fresh and new approach to the Amnesia world while staying true to its origins.\nUnique physics interaction that has been developed and improved since 2005.\nExceptional artwork and environments that run on low system specifications.\nThe darkest, most horrific tale ever told in a videogame. Stunning soundtrack by award-winning composer Jessica Curry.",

    "description": "In ARC Raiders, gameplay flows between the surface ruled by lethal machines, and the vibrant underground society of Speranza. Craft, repair, and upgrade your gear in the safety of your own workshop, before venturing topside to scavenge the remnants of a devastated but beautiful world. Play solo or in parties up to three, navigating the constant threat of ARC's machines and the unpredictable choices of fellow survivors. In the end, only you decide what kind of Raider you are - and how far you’ll go to prevail.\nExplore four distinct maps at launch, with more to be revealed as the underground society evolves and expands its reach. Each destination carries the weight of a world twice-destroyed, and the scars of conflicts both old and new. Sift through the remnants for valuable loot, and piece together the past as it's slowly reclaimed by nature. Evolving map conditions ensure that no two runs are the same, with varying weather, enemies, and mechanics adding unpredictability and danger.\nIn a society built on boldness and bravado, it is up to you to stake your claim as a Raider. The loot you scavenge can be sold for coin or crafted into all-new gear, allowing you take on increasingly lethal dangers head-on. Through both victories and hardships, you'll gain valuable experience; unlocking varied skills that enable all-new ways of play. In addition, you'll complete quests for Traders with differing motives and agendas; uncovering both the friction and comradery of a community under constant threat of collapse.\nLethal machines known as ARC rule the surface, ranging from unrelenting drone swarms to mechanical giants that obliterate everything in their path. Their origins remain a mystery, but their ever-present danger is felt with every step you take. Each machine comes with distinct strengths and tactics, forcing you to pinpoint their weak spots and constantly think on your feet. And remember: the noise of battle carries. Other Raiders may be listening; eager to claim what you leave behind.\nRaiders survive by kitbashing scavenged materials; using long-lost tech and looted ARC parts to craft weapons, gadgets, and gear. Upgrade your workshop stations and learn blueprints to craft even more advanced items, or improvise quick fixes in the field to get yourself out of a bind. As you make a name for yourself, you'll be able to measure your skill against other Raiders by taking on Trials; rising through the leaderboards to earn valuable rewards.\nIn Speranza, everyone has an agenda, and the Traders are no different. They’ll send you topside on missions in exchange for rewards, slowly revealing more about who they are and what they want for Speranza’s future. Complete quests to earn gear, crafting materials, and XP to level up your Raider and unlock new skill points.\nThe ARC Raiders skill tree branches into three paths: Survival, Mobility, and Conditioning. Spend your points to shape your playstyle. Loot faster and move quieter with Survival skills. Outmaneuver your opponents and threats with Mobility. And enhance your Strength and Stamina with Conditioning. Choose how you grow and what your Raider brings to the battle.\nWhether you’re preparing to take down specific ARC enemies or fend off rival Raiders, there's a choice of weaponry for every fight. Cater to your style with a range of firearms including SMGs, rifles and shotguns, as well as more advanced options such as railguns and energy weapons. Grenades, traps, ziplines and deployables offer the tactical depth needed to outsmart your enemies, while augments allow you to tailor your loadout to your preferred playstyle; unlocking dedicated inventory slots and additional gameplay perks.",

Unlike his peers’ brute-force tactics, Sayl thrives on cunning and deception.\nA master schemer, Sayl uses an array of Manipulations to weaken his enemies by disrupting the logistics of their armies, throwing their settlements in disarray and even directly whispering lies that warp and sever their diplomatic ties with friends and neighbours. Even his own forces are subject to the machinations of the Twisted Seer of the Waste in their march to victory and doom. Growing in power unlocks additional Manipulations, ever more potent and treacherous but relying on them is equally as treacherous. Too many Manipulations in a short time span will inevitably attract dark, malevolent attention that Sayl needs to navigate around or else he will suffer for his transgressions.\nEver-thirsty to magnify his sorcerous strength, Sayl strives to enact a great ritual. To do this, he must construct Chaos Altars, allowing him to channel great arcane power. Through enacting rituals, he will face many battles, events and dilemmas in his quest for supreme power, including his greatest challenge, if he is to claim the ultimate prize.\nSayl’s army blends sorcery, monstrosities, and betrayal-driven creations.

In this game, you can peacefully live alongside mysterious creatures known as Pals or risk your life to drive off a ruthless poaching syndicate.\nPals can be used to fight, or they can be made to work on farms or factories.\nYou can even sell them or eat them!\nSurvival\nIn a harsh environment where food is scarce and vicious poachers roam, danger waits around every corner. To survive, you must tread carefully and make difficult choices...even if that means eating your own Pals when the time comes.\nMounts & Exploration\nPals can be mounted to traverse the land, sea and sky—allowing you to traverse all kinds of environment as you explore the world.\nBuilding Structures\nWant to build a pyramid? Put an army of Pals on the job. Don't worry; there are no labor laws for Pals.\nProduction\nMake use of Pals and their skills to make fire, generate electricity, or mine ore so that you can live a life of comfort.\nFarming\nSome Pals are good at planting seeds, while others are skilled at watering or harvesting crops. Work together with your Pals to create an idyllic farmstead.\nFactories & Automation\nLetting Pals do the work is the key to automation. Build a factory, place a Pal in it, and they'll keep working as long as they're fed—until they're dead, that is.\nDungeon Exploration\nWith Pals on your side you can tackle even the most dangerous areas. When the time comes, you might have to sacrifice one to save your skin. They'll protect your life—even if it costs their own.\nBreeding & Genetics\nBreed a Pal and it will inherit the characteristics of its parents. Combine rare pals to create the strongest Pal of them all!\nPoaching & Crime\nEndangered Pals live in wildlife sanctuaries. Sneak in and capture rare Pals to get rich quick! It's not a crime if you don't get caught, after all.\nMultiplayer\nMultiplayer is supported, so invite a friend and go on an adventure together! And of course you can battle your friends and trade Pals, too.\nIn online co-op play mode, up to 4 players can play together.\nAdditionally, a dedicated server can allow up to 32 players to play together.",

    "description": "Sail the high seas, lead mighty fleets, and forge your legacy in\nWar Sails\n, the epic single-player expansion for\nMount & Blade II: Bannerlord\n. Bringing naval warfare to\nBannerlord\nfor the first time,\nWar Sails\nlets players command powerful ships, engage in thrilling sea battles, and master maritime conquest.\nEmbark on daring naval adventures with new mechanics, territories, and challenges. Customize your fleet, conquer settlements, and carve your legend on the high seas!\nChart your course to the Northern Kingdom, home of the fearless Nords—legendary seafarers and masters of close-quarters combat. Explore a land of jagged peaks, vast taigas and freezing fjords, where scattered settlements rise like ships from the sea. A bold adventurer may trade their goods, recruit their warriors, join their ranks or challenge their rule. Will you join the North or seize its riches?\nWar Sails\nintroduces a unique and immersive naval warfare system that has been inspired by accounts of actual medieval sea battles. Featuring realistic wind and water physics, ship-to-ship combat lets you board enemies from multiple points, ram them, or attack from afar.\nCaptains can seize opportunities by boarding already engaged ships, prepare for an incoming attack by creating a floating fortress or take a risk to tie down several enemies at once - giving their allies an edge elsewhere. They may ram an enemy ship to sink it - or at least throw men off board, shatter oars and compromise buoyancy. Well-placed arrows and ballista fire can also tear through sails, further crippling mobility.\nCalradia has been reimagined with a northern region, a settled island, coastal waters and open seas. The dynamic weather system was also refined to include storms and trade winds. Ships move faster when riding the gales, but beware—attrition can unravel even the best-laid plans.\nThe naval systems and Nord faction integrate into\nBannerlord’s\nworld, reshaping trade, warfare, and diplomacy. Ship production and new trade goods add regional variety. Coastal towns may grow rich from this — if they can fend off pirates and naval invasions.\nSieges have also been adapted to naval warfare. Armies will have to bring along a fleet and set up a blockade, if they want to stop supplies and reinforcements arriving over sea.\nCommand 20 unique ships, from nimble trade vessels to towering war galley. Includes 15 warships, 4 trade ships, and a civilian fishing ship - each modelled after historical vessels, with distinct handling shaped by realistic wind and wave physics. They can be customized with siege engines, cargo holds, sails, rams, and more. Shipyards build and stock vessels based on their town’s culture and development. Players can also capture ships and figureheads in battle.\nThe character system has been extended with Nord hairstyles, beards, and tattoos. Three nautical skills were added that enhance navigation, tactics, and stewardship. There are also many new items including spears, swords, axes, shields, and armor.\nTroop trees now include mariner troops that are more effective at sea. Players can also recruit new companions with maritime backgrounds.\nA new questline introduces players to the seas of Calradia through cinematics, scripted missions, and classic\nMount & Blade\ngameplay. Learn how to command your ship, then take it into battle against a pirate confederacy. Lead a growing fleet of newfound allies as you face a range of nautical challenges.\nCommand fleets your way. Set up and customize your own engagements - choose your hero, faction, and fleet composition, from ship types and randomized upgrades to crew type balance and composition - then set wind, season, and time of day across River, Coastal, or Open Sea maps. No campaign needed.\nThe sounds of the sea come to life with new Mediterranean and Nordic-inspired musical tracks. Experience rich soundscapes with piercing winds, crashing waves and creaking ships. Feel the heat of battle as steel clashes and sailors cry out.",

    "description": "Lured, enslaved, and left to rust. The Alloyed Collective now stirs from the scrap of their fallen allies, driven by a singular purpose: returning home. Master 2 new Survivors and descend deep into Petrichor V to take on the Alloyed Collective’s ultimate creation.\nFrom crumbling cliffs to scorching deserts and buried machine caverns, dive deeper into Solus territory, where every step forward means trespassing further into something you were never meant to see. There are 7 stages and 1 additional variant coming with Alloyed Collective. Let’s take a quick tour through a few.\nAsh howls across the fractured cliffside of Pretender’s Precipice. Strewn across the ground are the twisted metal experiments of fallen Solus tech. Duck through narrow nests and detour into the massive, hollowed-out casing of a once-hulking construct. The Precipice is a rusting maze of tunnels and elevation where danger hides just out of view.\nEmerge from Pretender’s Precipice and arrive at the Iron Alluvium. This desert mining outpost has a habit of reminding you that it was built for machines, not interlopers. One hulking drill grinds deeper into the heart of Petrichor V. Survive and be rewarded with loot scattered through winding caves where iron veins once ran.\nDo everything right and you’ll break into the cable-strewn peaks of Conduit Canyon. Find a way to hook the power nodes back up, venture down the canyon, and take on a foe unlike anything Petrichor V has ever seen.\nEvery drone under Operator’s control is a tool waiting to be unleashed. Command a companion to launch you skyward and rain destruction from above, or overcharge it and send it hurtling into a crowd to blow them apart. When your crosshair marks a target, a single command triggers a tongue of flames, strafing run, or healing burst from the drone you have queued. The smart Operators among you will string these abilities together to dominate the battlefield and support their allies.\nDrifter is the junk drawer of the Risk of Rain world. Except this junk drawer is able to pick you up and throw you off a cliff. Or throw a monster off a cliff. Or a chest at a boss. Okay, maybe she’s not exactly like a junk drawer, but there are still some striking similarities.\nLand Blunt Force on your foes and they’ll spill their Junk, then decide whether to spend it on a quick burst of damage or save it to create an assortment of Temporary Items… or a glorious cube that you can bat around to your heart’s content.\nExpand your toolkit with a full roster of combat and utility drones. Bombardment Drone paints the ground under targets and turns it into a lingering blast zone. Cleanup Drone turns fallen enemies into gold and health to keep runs rolling. Freeze Drone locks down groups with chilling crowd control, while Jailer Drone periodically roots priority threats. Barrier Drone grants periodic shielding to stabilize hectic fights. Transport Drone lifts (non-boss) enemies up in the air and drops them to their death.\nAlloyed Collective packs 18 fresh tools to combat its 6 new (standard) enemies.\nForge your way to higher ground with Hiker’s Boots to stack crit, turn your drone fleet into cute little demolitionists with Box of Dynamite, or rub your boots along the carpet and shock your foes with Faraday Spurs.\nBut now let’s turn our attention to a truly horrifying creature. Known by some UES crew members as “the cute rolling idiot,” the Solus Invalidator can be deceptively dangerous. Fail to move out of its way and have all of your Items temporarily invalidated.\nUp next, the Solus Scorcher. It has two loves in life: covering things in oil and catching those things on fire. Unfortunately, sometimes you are the ‘thing’. This Solus creation starts off by hurling a huge blob of oil that slows you down a bit. But the slow is the least of your problems: fail to get clear, and you’ll be lit by its follow-up flamethrower.\nBring your friends on the adventure! Only one player is required to own Alloyed Collective to enable the Monsters, Stages, and Items to appear in-game for the whole lobby. Players without Alloyed Collective will be unable to select the two new Survivors or permanently unlock new Items, Logbooks, or other content.",

    "description": "Path of Exile 2 is a next generation Action RPG from Grinding Gear Games, featuring co-op for up to six players. Path of Exile 2 takes place in the land of Wraeclast, a dark continent populated by unique cultures, ancient secrets, and monstrous dangers. A sinister threat, long thought destroyed, has begun creeping back on the edge of civilisation, driving people mad and sickening the land with Corruption.\nPath of Exile 2 features a brand new campaign with six acts, 100 distinct environments, 600 monsters and 100 bosses.\nTwelve Character Classes\nPath of Exile 2 features twelve character classes, two for every combination of Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence. While each of the class variants focuses on a different playstyle, they're just a starting point. You can combine skills from many classes together to create your ideal character build.\nEach of the twelve character classes has its own three Ascendancy specialisations, resulting in a total of 36 Ascendancy Classes to pick between.\nNew Skill Gem System\nPath of Exile 2 features 240 Skill Gems that grant devastating active skills and 200 Support Gems that modify their behaviour. Combine these together to create your perfect build.\nThis is the next generation of Path of Exile's famous skill system. Support Gems are now socketed directly into Skill Gems, removing many of the frustrations present in the old system while maintaining all the previous depth. It's now possible to six-link every skill your character uses.\nDual-specialise your Passive Skill Tree\nPath of Exile's iconic Passive Skill Tree has made a return, with 1,500 skills that allow you to completely customise your gameplay experience. It now features Dual Specialisation, the ability to allocate some passive skill points to two different sets of skills. They engage whenever the appropriate weapon or skill type is used. For example, you can have some points allocated to both daggers and traps, or ice and lightning, and as you swap between attacks, the appropriate skill points will apply. This lets you specialise in multiple areas without opportunity cost.\nUncover All-new Items\nPath of Exile 2 features 700 equipment base types and every single one has its own unique item you can find. You can augment your arsenal with new weapons such as Spears, Crossbows and Flails, as well as supplementary items like Focuses, Traps and redesigned Sceptres.\nEncounter Unique Bosses\nIn Path of Exile 2, every area of the Campaign contains a boss encounter. There's over a hundred bosses to fight as you make your way through the Acts and they all have unique mechanics to learn.\nExplore a New Endgame\nCompleting the campaign is just the beginning. The endgame in Path of Exile 2 includes countless areas in different biomes, powerful crafting, challenging bosses, unique encounters and much more. Unlock new paths and explore further into the world.\nAs you progress through the endgame, you will gain access to special passive trees that can boost the rewards of your maps and change the way the various endgame mechanics work. These trees will make your maps more rewarding but also more difficult.\nPath of Exile 2 introduces sequels to several leagues from Path of Exile. While their mechanics are familiar, the monsters, bosses, rewards and progression are all new.\nFair-To-Play. Never Pay-To-Win.\nPath of Exile 2 is a separate game to the original Path of Exile. We will continue to offer expansions for both games going forward. They  will never be \"pay to win\". Purchases are shared between the two games.",

He’s not great at keeping things in order, so your task is to buy low, fix up, and sell high. Over time, as you master your initial challenges, you’ll have the chance to take over the business, and then…\nEverything will be in your hands! Build a business that fulfills your customers’ automotive fantasies. From budget-friendly cars to top-tier rides, seize opportunities, hire the best, provide excellent service, and maximize profits. Grow your company day by day.\nThe key to achieving high profits lies in negotiating when buying old cars. Look for great deals, and during price haggling, stay firm and professional.\nNot all purchased cars are in working condition, so you’ll need to transport them using one of two types of tow trucks.\nEvery car requires diagnostics and preparation before being sold. Mechanical repairs, bodywork, painting, and small touch-ups will significantly increase the selling price.\nPresenting a car to the customer requires a few tricks. Washing, good photos, and an engaging advertisement will be your allies. Highlight the car’s strengths in your listing, but remember—every car has its hidden flaws. Customers buy with their eyes, so use the shine of the paint, a full tank, and quality photos to your advantage.\nYour profits will allow you to continually grow your company. Upgrade tools, repair zones, and your customer service office. Hire employees to boost efficiency. Manage your finances wisely and maintain your company’s reputation. But stay vigilant—competition, and even your “helpful neighbors,” never rest. Protect what you’ve tirelessly built from potential threats.",

    "description": "Total War: WARHAMMER II is a strategy game of titanic proportions. Choose from four unique, varied factions and wage war your way – mounting a campaign of conquest to save or destroy a vast and vivid fantasy world.\nThis is a game of two halves – one a turn-based open-world campaign, and the other intense, tactical real-time battles across the fantastical landscapes of the New World.\nPlay how you choose – delve into a deep engrossing campaign, experience unlimited replayability and challenge the world in multiplayer with a custom army of your favourite units. Total War: WARHAMMER II offers hundreds of hours of gameplay and no two games are the same.\nEngage in statecraft, diplomacy, exploration and build your empire, turn by turn. Capture, build and manage teeming settlements and recruit vast armies. Level up Legendary Lords and Heroes and arm them with mythical weapons and armour. Negotiate alliances or declare Total War to subjugate any that stand between you and your goal.\nCommand thousands-strong legions of soldiers in intense tactical battles. Send forth ferocious, twisted monsters, fire-breathing dragons and harness powerful magic. Utilise military strategies, lay ambushes, or use brute force to turn the tide of combat and lead your forces to victory.\nThe second in a trilogy and sequel to the award-winning Total War: WARHAMMER, Total War: WARHAMMER II brings players a breath-taking new narrative campaign, set across the vast continents of Lustria, Ulthuan, Naggaroth and the Southlands. The Great Vortex Campaign builds pace to culminate in a definitive and climactic endgame, an experience unlike any other Total War title to date.\nPlaying as one of 8 Legendary Lords across 4 iconic races from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, players must succeed in performing a series of powerful arcane rituals in order to stabilise or disrupt The Great Vortex, while foiling the progress of the other races.\nEach Legendary Lord has a unique geographical starting position, and each race offers a distinctive new playstyle with unique campaign mechanics, narrative, methods of war, armies, monsters, Lores of Magic, legendary characters, and staggering new battlefield army abilities.\nShortly after launch, owners of both the original game and Total War™ WARHAMMER II will gain access to the colossal third campaign. Exploring a single open-world epic map covering the Old World and the New World, players may embark on monumental campaigns as any owned Race from both titles.\nEach of the Races in Total War™ WARHAMMER II will be playable in single and multiplayer campaign, plus custom and multiplayer battles. As the two Legendary Lords for each race all have their own unique campaign start positions, you’ll be able to play a 2-player co-op campaign as the same race. If you own both parts 1 and 2, you’ll be able to play in multiplayer as any of the races you own.\nMillennia ago, besieged by a Chaos invasion, a conclave of High Elf mages forged a vast, arcane vortex. Its purpose was to draw the Winds of Magic from the world as a sinkhole drains an ocean, and blast the Daemonic hordes back to the Realm of Chaos. Now the Great Vortex falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin.\nPowerful forces move to heal the maelstrom and avert catastrophe. Yet others seek to harness its terrible energies for their own bitter purpose. The race is on, and the very fate of the world will lie in the hands of the victor.\nPrince Tyrion, Defender of Ulthuan, guides the High Elves in their desperate efforts to stabilise the vortex as it roils above their home continent.\nAtop his palanquin-throne, the Slann Mage-Priest Mazdamundi directs his Lizardmen war-hosts as they surge northward from Lustria. He, too, is intent on preventing cataclysm, though the methods of The Old Ones must prevail.\nThe Witch King Malekith and his sadistic Dark Elf hordes spew forth from Naggaroth and their labyrinthine Black Arks. He tastes great weakness in the vortex – and great opportunity in its demise.\nMeanwhile the Skaven, led by Queek Headtaker, stir in their foetid subterranean tunnels. There they multiply unchecked and look hungrily towards the surface, their motives obscured. The time for revelation is nigh…\nFour races, four outcomes, a single goal: control of the Great Vortex, for good or ill.",

Make a new best friend while exploring a haunted mansion, right before playing a hand of cards with a robot, alien, and eight-foot tall wolf.\nIn VRChat, there are hundreds of thousands of worlds, millions of avatars –\nall created by the users\n. No matter what you’re into, there’s a space in VRChat for you. And if there isn’t, we’ll give you the tools to make your dream a reality.\nWhile not required to join in on the fun, VRChat was built to take advantage of VR headsets in many unique ways. That means avatars that flow with your movement, and systems that work alongside various hardware platforms to provide full-body tracking, finger tracking, and much, much more.\nThere’s something magical around every corner. Come take a look, and see what you find.\nIn VRChat, there’s always something to do – and people to meet there.\nVisit a planetarium and have a chat about astronomy. Go on a virtual hike through a majestic fantasy forest. Pull up to a car meet, and talk shop with some gearheads. Attend a live music event underneath a chemical storage facility, and talk obscure genres with DJs. Once you find your crowd, join their Group, and you'll be able to find them again the next time you're on.\nYour community –\nwhatever it is\n– is here.\nThere are thousands of games to play in VRChat. Try running a kitchen in a busy restaurant, or racing go-karts in zero gravity. Fancy a battle royale? We’ve got those, too -- just probably with a wider diversity of avatars than you’ve ever seen before.\nIt doesn’t matter what you like to play: casual card games, shooters, racing, platformers, puzzles, horror, and of course, endless party games. If you want to play it, it probably exists here (and if it doesn't, you can build it yourself).\nEverything here was built by the community using the VRChat SDK. Combined with Unity and Udon, our in-house scripting language, we give our users as much power as possible to build whatever their imaginations can conjure up.\nBut creation isn’t just limited to worlds.\nVRChat provides a level of creative freedom that is unmatched anywhere else, and nowhere is that reflected best than on the avatars of our users. In VRChat, you can be anything, and explore your identity however you’d like. Want to be an alien? A talking dog? A sentient shoe with glowing bits that react to the beat of music by changing color?\nI mean, sure, if that’s what you’re about.\nCome on in -- hundreds of thousands of worlds (and a whole bunch of new friends!) are waiting for you.",

Start off as an insignificant village and build, scheme, and fight your way towards a mighty city state and empire. The mechanics are deep and true to life, where small events can spiral into the collapse of kingdoms.\nFull of different races, cultures, old and new gods and strange creatures - everything in Songs of Syx is connected. Night turns to day, climate and weather change, and migrations of animals and people flow. Droughts and pestilence, raiders, traders and bandits, and new discoveries will ensure kingdoms and empires come and go with or without your intervention. Everything you do generates new unique stories and worlds each time you play a new game.\nWin the hearts of your subjects or whip them into submission. Have their number swell your insignificant village into a metropolis of your design. Watch tens of thousands of individually simulated citizens and slaves interact: each with their own life, religion, fears and desires.\nBuild each house, street and plaza with utmost care in order to keep the needs of your citizens, your state and your army balanced.\nBut be careful not to overreach: everything you build requires upkeep and a slight disruption to your production, or a dip in your standing, could quickly spiral out of control. Your people will not hesitate to turn against an incompetent ruler.\nRecruit, train and equip citizens of your great city. Gather allies and vassals, conscript traveling mercenaries and local peasants to bolster your ranks with up to 50,000 individual units. Use tactics and skill to encircle your enemy in massive real-time battles, or let your reputation demoralize them before the fight.\nEach soldier is simulated and will require supplies produced by the industrial might of your great state. The outcome of battle will dictate the rise and fall of empires.\nBreak the backs of slaves as they make your beds and swab your floors. Just throw them a bone from time to time to keep them from rising up in revolt. Appoint nobles, or import them from other kingdoms and have them manage different aspects of your kingdom to boost your production and standing, but be careful with whom to trust, and reward them accordingly as some might get the idea to usurp you or join your enemies.\nAs your capital grows, it must be sustained by the villages, towns, lumber camps, castles and ports that constitute your kingdom. But you are not alone. Other kingdoms and despots are either eager to forge an alliance or expand their borders, so tend to your relations. To grow your might, you must engage in diplomacy, trade and war.\nThanks to the fulfilment of our first Kickstarter stretchgoal the game will have a fully fledged soundtrack made by\n@jasinkamusic\n. We already have some tracks done which neatly fit into the playable prototype.",

You awake on a mysterious island, your senses overwhelmed by the blinding sunlight and brilliant colors bouncing off every surface around you, the azure waters of a verdant Island lapping at your bare feet. A deep roar echoes from the misty jungle, jolting you into action, and you stand up – not afraid, but intrigued. Are you ready to form a tribe, tame and breed hundreds of species of dinosaurs and other primeval creatures, explore, craft, build, and fight your way to the top of the food-chain? Your new world awaits… step through the looking-glass and join it!\nFEATURES\nARK: Survival Ascended has completely recreated and redesigned the artwork and worlds of ARK to take advantage of the latest in videogame technology, Unreal Engine 5, using high-end graphics features such as fully dynamic Global Illumination (“Lumen”), so that light bounces realistically off of surfaces and provides realistic reflections, and advanced mesh streaming (“Nanite”) of hundreds of millions of triangles for extreme detail.\nAdvanced new physics systems such as dynamic water so that every creature creates waves, ripples, splashes, and bubbles as they move through fluids, and fully interactive physical foliage where every blade of grass, bush, and tree reacts to characters, explosions, projectiles, and physics objects. Knock down a tree, and see it crash into other trees and disturb all the foliage on its way down to smacking into the grass below! Detect an enemy moving sneakily through the grass as it shifts and sways in response to their presence. Demolish a building and watch the pieces break apart realistically, interacting with the grass and water as they fall.\nARK: Survival Ascended includes access to all of ARK’s worlds, including Scorched Earth, Aberration, Extinction, ARK Genesis Part 1, ARK Genesis Part 2, and more. The Island, Scorched Earth, Aberration and The Center are released now, Extinction will be released on December 16\n,\nwith the subsequent expansion worlds to be added at no additional cost on a regular basis.\nThe definitive survival experience returns better than ever: design your Survivor, form a tribe, and tame, train, breed & ride dinosaurs within a living ecosystem. Watch your food, water, temperature, and weather patterns. Slowly expand outwards as you harvest, build structures, farm crops, customize your visual designs, and proceed to explore to uncover the true nature of The Island and the worlds beyond.\nThorough Quality of Life revamps in every area: redesigned User Interfaces, dynamic navigation for intelligent creature pathfinding, Wild Babies, Photo Mode, new Camera systems, new Map system, Tracking System, new Structures and Items, new Creatures, and much more.\nCross-Platform Modding: Download & play new custom content created by players, including new maps, creatures, items, and game modes, through a dedicated mod collection directly within the game!

This is all while you keep your Exhibits safe, rooms clean, staff happy… and children off the dinosaur bones.\nAs Curator, the design and management of your expanding museum is in your hands!

Thieves, and more frequently, children, are known for touching and grubbing up the displays, so make sure enough security is guarding your prized collection!\nGet creative to design your museum layout your way! You have decorative freedom, so design thematic areas to guide your guests’ visit. Splash paint and lay carpet as you lovingly arrange each prehistoric fern, potentially melting iceman, and dinosaur remains wherever you see fit.\nOnce you’ve created the perfect atmosphere, arrange guided tours with custom routes led by a charismatic Expert. Tours are a fantastic way to enrich your guests' experience. To keep guests enthused, showcase Exhibits with the highest Buzz - those that are top quality, provide ample info and beautiful decorations are likely to attract the most donations!\nGuests know best! The different types of guests who will frequent your museum may have different interests, but they do have some things in common… they expect the place to be kept clean, have plenty of refreshments, ample toilets, and a gift shop filled with goodies. And, of course, they need to be dazzled with knowledge of your Exhibits, which are kept well-maintained…\nTwo Point County will bring a variety of guests to your museum, and they all hope to discover their new favourite Exhibit… From dino fanatics and botany buffs to haunted horror seekers, you’ll need to cater to their personal preferences to meet their needs. By exceeding their expectations, you can keep them engaged, leading to longer visits, increased donations, and glowing reviews!",

Only this time,\nyou are the intended target\n.\nSingle-Player Campaign\nA story told through the lens of Eli Reed, an accountant-for-hire who ends up on the wrong side of the gun. Redlisted and on the run, you must uncover the mystery of who placed the bounty and why. Utilize near-future weaponry to take out your enemies as you take steps to clear your name.\nHeavily inspired by gritty narratives we played growing up, the story unfolds in a way that keeps you at the edge of your seat. 9 missions spread out over 9 incredible hand-crafted environments, telling the story of one mans journey out of Transience.\nFully Voiced Dialogue\nCombat and Stealth Gadgets\nMulti-Approach Maps\nTactical Stealth Action\nInspired by many tactical games from back in the day, we aimed to combine the maneuverability and fluidity of a Third Person Stealth game, with the slower pacing of a First Person Shooter. Become the spectre in the walls, the shadow picking off survivors one by one. Sometimes staying out of sight is only one way to complete the objective. Sometimes a more active and aggressive hand is required. Transience offers the player a ton of ways to approach objectives, from Stalking in the shadows, Running and Gunning down corridors or a blend of both. Utilize an arsenal of customizable weaponry to make your enemies fear your presence. You are the accountant.\nDeep Weapon Customization\nPowered by NWS™ (New World Systems) this industry-wide standard has allowed weapons manufacturers to interchange attachments and core parts at will. Take an SMG and turn it into an Assault Rifle or take an Assault Rifle and modify it into a DMR. Throughout the story, you will find attachments and weapons via stashes found around the environments that allow you to build and customize weapons on the fly. With 13 base weapons to discover throughout the campaign, NWS™ makes your survival odds that much easier.\nA Whole New World\nTake on the city of New Houston in the year 2056. Peace has been torn apart by a sudden conflict overseas, resulting in war-time prosperity. Government contracts are king, and advancement at any cost for the war effort drives industry in America. Corporations have gained so much influence from the new status quo that they have become the de facto law of the land. Currency is shifting towards digital under the government’s nose, funded by the innovative new technologies in their most dangerous forms being researched and shipped out to the war. Propaganda insists that the scraps of progress trickle down to the citizens, a half-truth. Access the advanced technology of corporate influence, from shrinking forms of medical tech to quieter suppressors and magnetic subway lines, the city is full of gadgets to use and weaknesses to exploit.\nNNCG \"Eclipse\" Suit\nDeveloped by NOVASKIN™ - This Nitro-capsule Gilded Undersuit was initially built for the war efforts overseas. The suit provided the wearer with solid kevlar-superior protection for quick engagements, featuring lightweight armor panels attached to a thin form-fitting undersuit. Powered by N-caps, this low-energy-consumption equipment is one of several premier front-line suit designs in existence today, always outperforming its competition by a country mile. The secret is in the underlying layer of specially developed Non-Newtonian Colloid that temporarily provides the wearer with reactive armor. Hardly anything can pierce this extremely effective protection whilst it's active. This suit will also give you access to a number of gadgets to help you along your journey: from a distraction tool, to a Flash Pulse for blinding enemies. And, of course, Night Vision.",

    "description": "RimWorld is a sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller.\nInspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune.\nYou begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world.\nManage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, illnesses and addictions.\nBuild in the forest, desert, jungle, tundra, and more.\nWatch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses.\nReplace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others.\nFight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines.\nCraft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials.\nTame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts.\nTrade with passing ships and caravans.\nForm caravans to complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony.\nDig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires.\nCapture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery.\nDiscover a new generated world each time you play.\nExplore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the Steam Workshop.\nLearn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor.\nRimWorld is a story generator.\nIt’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the\nAI Storyteller\n. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.\nYour colonists are not professional settlers\n– they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.\nEach person’s background is tracked and affects how they play.\nA nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well.\nColonists develop - and destroy - relationships.\nEach has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.\nThe game generates a whole planet from pole to equator.\nYou choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.\nTravel across the planet.\nYou're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.\nYou can tame and train animals.\nLovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.\nPeople in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment.\nThey respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.\nWounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities.\nEye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.\nYou can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent.\nA peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.\nAnd there's much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an active modding community on the Steam Workshop.",

Battle across lush subtropics, arid deserts and snow-capped mountains. Marvel at legendary landmarks like the Great Wall of China and the Yangtze River.

Each of these characters is brought to life with their own unique personality, motivations, and likes/dislikes.

With beautiful UI, vibrant vistas and authentic Chinese-inspired artwork, this reimagining of ancient China is a visual feast.\nThe turn-based campaign and real-time battles of Total War: THREE KINGDOMS are more interconnected than ever before.

    "description": "You're on a path in the woods, and at the end of that path is a cabin. And in the basement of that cabin is a Princess.\nYou're here to slay her. If you don't, it will be the end of the world.\nShe will do everything in her power to stop you. She'll charm, and she'll lie, and she'll promise you the world, and if you let her, she'll kill you a dozen times over. You can't let that happen. Don't forget, the fate of the world rests on your shoulders.\nYou're not going to listen to him, are you? We're supposed to save princesses, not slay them...\nFeatures\nFully voice-acted\nby the impeccable Jonathan Sims and Nichole Goodnight.\nHand-penciled art\n- every background and sprite is drawn traditionally with pencil and paper by Ignatz-winning graphic novelist Abby Howard.\nA princess.\nShe's very bad and you have to get rid of her for all our sakes.\nNo, the Princess isn't a “cosmic horror,” whatever that is supposed to mean.\nShe's just an ordinary human Princess\n, and you can definitely slay her as long as you put your mind to it.\nDon't even think about trying to romance her.\nIt won't end well for you.\nHopefully you won't die.\nBut if you do, you'll die a lot. Be careful and stay focused on the task at hand!\nA branching narrative\nwhere what you say and what you believe determines both who you are and how the story unfolds. Though I wouldn’t recommend taking any paths outside of the one I lay before you.\nA new roleplaying experience from the creators of Scarlet Hollow.\nSlay the Princess is a choice-driven psychological horror visual novel/dating sim with dramatic branching, light RPG elements, and hand-penciled art.\nWhat’s in the Pristine Cut?\n3 brand new chapters replete with mysteries—and consequences.\nExpansions to familiar routes. The Den, The Apotheosis and The Fury each have each more than doubled in length.\nOver 35% more content overall—and all of it filled with great opportunities to listen to me and do your job.\nA new ending. And hopefully one that saves the world rather than damns it.\nTrack Your Progress: Cherish your memories, relive your exploits, and uncover deeply hidden secrets with the new gallery feature.\nOver 1,200 New Hand-Penciled Frames hand-illustrated by Abby Howard.\nOver 2,500 New Lines of Dialogue fully voiced dialogue by the impeccable Jonathan Sims and Nichole Goodnight.",

    "description": "Manor Lords is a strategy game that allows you to experience the life of a medieval lord. Grow your starting village into a bustling city, manage resources and production chains, and expand your lands through conquest.\nInspired by the art and architecture of late 14th century Franconia, Manor Lords prioritizes historical accuracy wherever possible, using it to inform gameplay mechanics and visuals alike. Common medieval tropes are avoided in favor of historical accuracy in order to make the world feel more authentic, colorful, and believable.\nManor Lords provides a gridless city-building experience with full freedom of placement and rotation. Building mechanics are inspired by the growth of real medieval towns and villages, where major trade routes and the landscape influenced how settlements formed and developed.\nSpreading outward from a central marketplace, build your residential, commercial, and industrial districts following the natural lay of the land. Establish farms based on soil fertility, position hunting grounds according to animal populations, and ensure access to adequate resource deposits and forests to provide the raw materials needed for growth.\nAssign areas for housing and watch your residents build their homes in accordance with the historical burgage plot system. Each area will be subdivided based on your roads and the allotted space, and homes will scale accordingly.\nBuild extensions behind larger homes to generate resources that would not otherwise be available. Homeowners don't just pay taxes – they grow vegetables, raise chickens and goats, and otherwise supply themselves and other townsfolk with essential needs beyond what your managed farms, pastures, and industries can provide.\nGuide your settlements through the unique demands and opportunities of each season, enjoying the bounty brought by spring rains and preparing for the harsh snows of winter.\nFrom boots to barley and hides to honey, Manor Lords features a great variety of goods fitting of the era. Materials need to be transported and processed into finished products through production chains, and you must balance the basic needs of your people against the desire to produce luxury items to ensure happiness, manufacture trade goods for export, or forge arms and armor to aid in your conquests.\nResources are littered across the map, encouraging you to expand and establish multiple specialized settlements. Extract valuable ores from your mining colonies, while villages devoted to agriculture, herding, or hunting supply the grains and meats needed to feed your growing populations. Will you spend your hard-earned influence to first acquire a rich source of iron for your smiths, or will you prioritize regions with fertile soil to serve as your breadbasket?\nUnchecked expansion will have a direct effect on the environment. Herds of deer will migrate away from encroaching civilization, lack of crop rotation will worsen soil fertility, and cutting down too many trees will result in deforestation.\nEstablish trade routes and sell surplus goods to traveling merchants to enrich your population. Manufacturing and exporting a variety of goods will provide wealth with which to upgrade your peoples’ homes, import goods you can’t produce yourself, and through taxes on said wealth, fill your own coffers.\nYours is but a small parcel of land in a vast territory, and the competing ambitions between you and rival lords will inevitably lead to conflict. Lead your people into battle, not as expendable units to be easily replenished, but as your beloved loyal subjects where every death is a cost worth considering.\nTrain a retinue of skilled warriors to fight battles alongside the levies you raise from the town militia. At times these soldiers will be needed to suppress banditry, and at other times you will lead your men into battle to conquer or defend territory. When needed, mercenaries are a costly option to bolster your ranks. Will you raise the militia at the first sign of trouble, bringing your economy to a stand-still as your peasants pick up arms and rush to form ranks, or will you spend your personal wealth to hire bands of sellswords instead?\nCommand real-time tactical battles, taking into consideration fatigue, weather conditions, and equipment. Position your troops wisely – a smaller force can defeat a larger enemy, if commanded well.\nFeel the cost of battle, even in victory, as each fallen soldier represents a lost person from your city.\nThis game is a passion project started by a solo developer, grown through player support into a full team of passionate individuals ranging from programmers and 2D artists to Game and Map Designers. You can reach out to us and share your opinions, ideas, and criticisms – we listen to your feedback.",

    "description": "Be sure to join the Ready or Not Discord server to keep up with the latest updates, find recruits for your squad, and have a good time!\n- The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home.\nIt has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.”\nIn response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city.\n“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.”\nThe Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team:\nWhether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals.\nThe role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality.\nMuch anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape.\nWe have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.",

    "description": "The Outer Worlds 2 is the eagerly-awaited sequel to the award-winning first-person sci-fi RPG from Obsidian Entertainment (just look at the exciting number of dashes in this sentence!). Time to clear your calendar – get ready for an action-packed adventure with a new crew, new weapons, and new enemies in a new colony! So much newness!\nAs a daring and most likely good-looking Earth Directorate agent, you must uncover the source of devastating rifts threatening to destroy all of humanity. Your investigation leads to Arcadia, home of skip drive technology, where the fate of the colony, and ultimately the entire galaxy, rests on your decisions—your strengths, your flaws, your crew, and the factions you choose to trust.\nThe Arcadia colony is engulfed in a factional war, as the Protectorate’s so-called benevolent rule is challenged by the rebellion of their religious order and a corporate invasion. As destructive rifts spread across the colony, each faction fights to control or close them for their own ends. Navigate diverse zones, uncover hidden lore, and shape the fate of a system on the brink!\nBuild your character with the abilities and choices that reflect your playstyle. The colony reacts to your every move, crafting a narrative that’s yours to own—whether you’re a disciple of diplomacy, an astute strategist, a crusader for chaos, or something different altogether. And yes, you can dumb!\nRecruit companions with unique traits, backgrounds and goals. Whether you choose to help them achieve their ambitions or steer them toward your own objectives, your influence shapes their growth (or death), making them an integral part of the immersive story you create together.\nHigh Fidelity Graphics\nExplore Arcadia with stunning visual detail. The Outer Worlds 2 supports true 4K resolution on compatible devices and unlocked framerates on PC, delivering smooth performance across sprawling alien landscapes, neon-lit cities, and fractured space environments.\nRay Tracing\nRay tracing adds depth and realism across Arcadia. From glowing rift anomalies to the reflections of neon signs on rain-soaked streets, advanced lighting, shadows, and reflections create a more dynamic and immersive experience.\nDLSS, FSR, and XeSS Support\nPlay with optimized performance across the board. The Outer Worlds 2 supports NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS upscaling, ensuring sharp visuals and higher frame rates no matter your GPU.\nHDR\nStep into Arcadia with high dynamic range support. HDR enhances contrast and color depth across compatible displays, making every neon light, alien sky, and weapon blast more vivid and lifelike.\nUltra-wide Support\nSee more of Arcadia with ultra-wide 21:9 display support. From massive corporate facilities to the vastness of space, a wider field of view delivers a more cinematic perspective on the colony’s fractured future.",

Sprint through the tight Valley corridors for hit-and-run strikes or plan a tactical siege in the Armory’s block-by-block warzone. But pay attention, nature doesn’t play by your rules - everchanging weather in the Dark Zone can alter every extraction into a new desperate gamble. Outthink, outgun, and extract - before the zone swallows you whole.\nArena Breakout: Infinite respects the depth military fans crave while welcoming newcomers with the red carpet treatment. For the die-hard military enthusiasts, this is a love letter to authenticity. Our Ultimate Gunsmith System features over 900 weapon mods on over 20 attachment slots to allow you to create your ultimate custom weapon.

Arena Breakout: Infinite strips away frustration so you can focus on the loot ‘n shoot fun.\nArena Breakout: Infinite offers a variety of game modes for all operators - Tactical Ops, Solo Ops, Covert Ops and fast-paced 4v4 Deathmatch modes. Whether you prefer tactical teamwork or going in alone, you decide how you take on the fight.\nThe Trophy Room is your off-field stronghold, where every upgrade and decoration tells your story. That rare sniper rifle, a stack of high-tier armor, or a collection of enemy dog tags - showcase all your hard-earned loot with pride!  Here, progression never stops and each season brings fresh challenges - complete weekly and seasonal tasks to unlock rewards that grow with your lethal reputation. The crown jewel? A free, top-tier 3X3 Titanium Case ensuring your most valuable loot stays safe no matter how tough the raid gets.\nIn Arena Breakout: Infinite, fair combat isn’t just a promise - it’s a guarantee with our ever-improving, anti-cheat system. This includes Killcam Replays that allow you to submit a one-tap report whenever you flag suspicious activity. Moreover, we don’t just punish cheaters - we make it right for you. If you’re confirmed to have lost loot, gear, or a match due to cheating, automatic in-game compensation will hit your inventory. Last year alone, our anti-cheat system placed 10-year bans to punish over 123,000 players, and reimbursed over 630,000 players with over 400 Billion Koens.",

Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you.\nREPEAT\nCheck the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.",

    "description": "You are an Exile, struggling to survive on the dark continent of Wraeclast, as you fight to earn power that will allow you to exact your revenge against those who wronged you. Created by hardcore gamers, Path of Exile is an online Action RPG set in a dark fantasy world. With a focus on visceral action combat, powerful items and deep character customization, Path of Exile is completely free and will never be pay-to-win.\nFreedom. Power. Revenge.\nPath of Exile is an online Action RPG designed around a strong online item economy and deep character customisation.\nPath of Exile is set in the dark fantasy world of Wraeclast. Scarred by mysterious catastrophes of the past and inhabited by creatures of nightmare, the very environment challenges exiles who dare explore it. You play as the Duelist, Witch, Ranger, Templar, Marauder, Shadow or the Scion class. From forsaken shores through to the city of Oriath, explore Wraeclast and uncover the ancient secrets waiting for you.\nUnlimited Character Customization\nCreate and customise hundreds of unique skill combinations from tradable itemised gems and our gigantic Passive Skill Tree. Combine skill gems, support gems and trigger gems to create your own unique combination of power, defence and destruction.\nAll of Path of Exile's character classes share its vast Passive Skill Tree. Starting at one of seven distinct locations dictated by their chosen class, players can focus on the core specialities of their class or travel across the tree to build complex combinations of skills from various disciplines. Scattered across the tree are Keystone passives, Masteries and Jewel Sockets that drastically alter the way a character is played.\nArmed to Kill\nPath of Exile is completely designed around items. Our flasks are persistent items that have mods. Our endgame areas can be found as Map items that have mods altering their challenges and rewards. We've gone as far as removing gold as a currency and basing our trade economy around orbs that can randomly reroll the properties of other items. We have carefully constructed our item system for veterans of the best Action RPGs.\nExplore the Atlas of Worlds\nThe Atlas of Worlds is a series of more than a hundred high-level maps that truly test the limits of your build. As you explore the Atlas, you will eventually unveil its dark secrets and face the most dangerous bosses that Wraeclast has ever seen.\nIn the true Path of Exile way, the Atlas of Worlds has its own Passive Skill Tree. Earn skill points for the Tree by completing maps on the Atlas and create your own unique endgame experience.\nDeadly Missions\nIn your journey through Wraeclast, you will meet fellow Exiles who seek your help. Capture wild beasts for Einhar, delve into the depths of the Azurite Mine with Niko, explore the secrets of the Temple of Atzoatl with Alva or investigate a mysterious Immortal Syndicate with Jun. Once received, these missions can be completed at any time in the endgame. This optional content in Path of Exile will reward you with valuable currency, powerful tradeable items and new ways of crafting.\nCustomise Your Hideout\n​In your extensive travels throughout the Acts and the Atlas of Worlds, you will discover secret locations swarmed with dangerous monsters. Defeat them, claim the Hideout for yourself and create your own personalised town. Use your Hideout as a quiet place to trade with other Exiles, craft after battle, or expand it and use it as a personalised Guild Hall with hundreds of decorations.\nBe Ruthless\nRuthless is an optional game mode which offers a more challenging way to play Path of Exile. Ruthless players can expect extreme item scarcity, limited crafting and many other changes such as support gems being drop-only. Ruthless is a mode about friction, tension and anticipation. It's much more difficult, but overcoming that difficulty feels highly rewarding. In a world where your items are far below par, every item drop has the potential to be the breakthrough one you need.\nFair-To-Play. Never Pay-To-Win.\nWe're committed to creating a fair playing field for all players. All Microtransactions in Path of Exile are purely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay.",

From their orbital station, prospectors drop to the planet surface to explore, harvest, craft and hunt while seeking their fortune.\nFrom toxic atmosphere to savage wildlife, apex predators to destructive storms and forest fires, Icarus is a planet with a temper. Preparation and planning are everything, whether it’s to find a source of oxygen, stalk your next meal or stockpile supplies for a long journey into the wilderness.\nGo at it alone, invite up to 8 Steam friends to join your game or play on dedicated servers.\nThe First Cohort of prospectors has been granted initial mining licenses for over 64 square kilometers of hand-crafted terrain, full of hidden caves and biomes to explore. Every single tree is harvestable, every rock can be voxel mined, every creature can be hunted. Tame and ride mounts, craft advanced tech to extract resources faster and prepare yourself for harsher challenges.\nUnlock four tiers of technology from hand-crafted to advanced composites and electronics, plus 8+ different building materials.\nChoose from over 100 talents as you specialize your character in exploring, building, farming, hunting, taming, fighting and more.\nReturn to the orbital workshop to exchange exotic matter for advanced tech and items with unique properties, which may give you an advantage on your next drop.\nHowever you want to experience Icarus, you can.\nForge your claim in Open World, battling the elements and apex predators for survival and testing the limits of your survival instincts.\nAccept timed Missions to mine exotics and earn Ren as you complete tasks for the power brokers overseeing the planet. Drop down to the planet with nothing, establish a base from scratch and escape in time.\nLet your creative mind run wild in the Outpost regions with regenerating resources and safe environments.\nIcarus was once destined to be a second Earth, but when terraforming collapsed - the air turned toxic and humanity’s hopes of colonizing a new world died. Icarus became a joke, a symbol of humanity reaching for the stars and failing. The xeno-engineers salvaged what they could, released modified embryos and halted the terraforming process.\nYet when they discovered the cause of the failure - exotic matter - new interest was ignited. Valuable beyond reckoning, these ‘exotics’ sparked a gold rush and fueled political tensions back on Earth.\nProspectors flocked to Icarus to complete contracts to extract exotics and conduct research for various factions. Those that survive return to orbit as seasoned veterans, converting their exotics into advanced technology, and taking on ever more challenging drops. Those that get left behind... are lost forever.\n---\nICARUS is being made by a team of survival game veterans at RocketWerkz in beautiful Auckland, New Zealand.",

    "description": "Crime Simulator IS NOT a stealth-focused simulation like\nThief Simulator.\nInstead, it's a fast-paced, roguelite grind character game, designed around risk, reward, and replayability.\nYou landed in jail, but a mysterious benefactor bailed you out. Now they want their money back - and fast. Your only chance is to do what you do best: commit crimes. Break into houses, steal valuables, and complete dangerous jobs alone or with up to three friends. Can you pay off your debt before the deadline passes?\nExplore\nthree distinct areas\n- each filled with unique targets, security setups, and plenty of loot. Whether you’re sneaking through high-tech mansions or brawling in shady neighborhoods, every location offers new challenges and hidden rewards.\nGo it alone or team up with friends in\n4-player co-op\n. Coordinate break-ins, split the loot, and watch each other’s backs - or pull a double-cross if you’re feeling bold. The choice is yours.\nEvery great heist starts with the right gear.\nLockpicks\nlet you slip through locked doors like a ghost, while a\ncrossbow\nsilently takes out guards or disables cameras. If you prefer a more hands-off approach,\npump sleeping gas\nthrough air vents and watch an entire building go down without a sound. But sometimes, subtlety isn’t an option - when things get messy, a trusty\nbaseball bat\ncan solve a lot of problems.\nAnd that’s just the beginning. The full game takes your toolkit to the next level with high-tech gadgets like drones for scouting, zip ties to keep troublemakers out of the way, and scanners to track down the most valuable loot. Adapt, improvise, and own every job your way.\nThe clock is always ticking, and your debt isn’t getting any smaller. Every job brings you closer to paying it off, but fail to meet your quota in time, you’ll lose everything. Plan your heists carefully, use your tools wisely, and take advantage of every opportunity. Need an edge? Buy insider tips online to uncover the best targets, scout security weaknesses, or find high-value loot.\nThe job seems too risky to play alone?\nCall in a backup -\nteam up with friends in co-op and make sure you get the payout before it’s too late.\nA true criminal gets better with every job. As you play, you’ll discover over 15 skills that can completely change how you operate. Expand your inventory to carry more tools and loot, sharpen your perception to spot threats from a distance, or master stealth to move undetected. Every skill unlocks a new way to outsmart security, take bigger risks, and pull off even bolder heists. The smarter you play, the more unstoppable you become.\nOnce you gain access to the voucher machine, you’ll unlock four powerful abilities that can turn the tide in your favor. Call off the cops when things get too hot - but only once per game, so use it wisely. Instantly repair all your loot and tools, ensuring you’re always ready for action. These rare perks can save your heist or help your team pull off the impossible. Choose carefully, because the right ability at the right moment can mean the difference between a perfect job and total failure.\nYour hideout isn’t just a place to lay low - it’s the key to getting stronger. Furnish it with items that grant powerful bonuses:\nA bed increases your health\n,\nTraining equipment increases your inventory capacity,\nand a treadmill? You will be sprinting like a pro.\nEvery upgrade makes you faster, tougher, and better prepared for the next big job. Customize your space and turn your hideout into the ultimate criminal HQ.",

You can perform this task alone or with up to three companions, cooperatively or maybe not so cooperatively!\nBe careful because the dungeons are dark and full of terrors, although as a professional cleaner this is not a problem, just don't step on a trap, and keep the monsters fed, you don't want them to eat you, or any of your friends.\nYou can clean the dungeons with three more employees, just watch what they do, because if they die you will have to clean their pieces and blood, the heroes already leave everything very dirty to make things worse.\nClean the dungeons in cooperative games for 4 players online.\nGoblin Maid:\nWhat better way to clean up than doing it like a pro? Play as a goblin alongside other goblins.\nClean:\nIt's your job to clean up the mess, so clean it up you shall! Use your Slimop, mimic, and slime dispenser tool to help you remove all that blood from the floor and ceiling!\nRestore Objects:\nTo ensure the dungeon returns to its original state, you must restore objects and place them back in their original positions.\nRestore Traps:\nWhat kind of dungeon would it be without traps? You'll need to restore and reactivate them. Be cautious; there might be traps that weren't triggered by adventurers and are still active.\nCreatures:\nYou'll also need to respawn creatures and dispose of their remains. Additionally, some creatures might not have perished.\nLoot:\nYou'll also need to refill chests with items.\nDynamic Dungeons:\nEach dungeon is filled with unique challenges...and hazards!",

    "description": "World of Tanks offers something for everyone: Try different tactics, vehicles, and modes!\nWorld of Tanks has a unique pace. Its armored vehicles are fast enough to draw you into the action, yet slow enough to give you time to think strategically. Good reflexes are always a plus, but it's smart and bold moves that can really turn the tide of a battle. Identify a weak spot in the enemy team's defense, move to an advantageous position at just the right moment, or ambush an opponent—and you'll feel like a champion.\nThe unique pace is yours to control: there are five vehicle types that each play very differently. Generally, light tanks rely on their speed and stealth, heavy tanks on their armor, and mediums on versatility. Tank destroyers (TDs) are feared damage dealers, and self-propelled guns (SPGs) hurl shells at enemies from afar, using an RTS-like view. Almost every one of the 800+ highly detailed vehicles, spread over 11 tiers and 11 nations, feels special.\nBegin with classic tanks and progress toward mighty high-tier machines. Adjust their performance to better suit your unique playstyle with crew perks, equipment, and Field Modification. Top that off with visual customization: showcase each vehicle's unique flair with custom paints, styles, and a wealth of other options.\nWorld of Tanks has received multiple and extensive upgrades to its graphics and physics since its launch in 2010. The maps feature unique landmarks and plenty of destructible objects. Vehicles get wet when in water, and they receive shell breaches from enemy rounds that penetrate, as well as pockmarks from rounds that bounce off. Guns and shell explosions have authentic, caliber-dependent sounds, and the acoustic environment is very rich, adding to immersion.\nThe basic mode is 15v15 Random Battles. Prominent regular modes include Onslaught (7v7 with extra special abilities), Frontline (30v30 on colossal maps with lots of tactical options such as airstrikes), and Steel Hunter (battle royale on mode-specific vehicles with field upgrades). On top of that, there are themed PvE and PvP events with unique rewards, clan-only Global Map and clan-based Strongholds, and more!\nWorld of Tanks is hard to master but easy to learn and enjoyable from the get-go. As a rookie, learn the basics from the Bootcamp scenarios, face easier opponents in lower-tier battles, and complete the Tank Academy missions for appealing rewards. A seasoned tanker friend can get you into the Referral Program, bagging great benefits for both of you.",

Safety, security, and secrecy are of the utmost importance… usually.\nAfter a catastrophic containment breach, your workplace has become a cosmic battle zone: anomalous entities are on the loose, enemies from other dimensions are invading via portals, and an arcane military sect - known as The Order - is targeting personnel and entities indiscriminately, aiming to seize artifacts and put an end to the chaos.\nContainment procedures have failed and help isn’t on the way. Stranded miles beneath the surface, it’s up to you and your fellow scientists to band together, plan your escape, and make this underground complex your new home - for now.\nAbiotic Factor brings a 90’s sci-fi twist and rich character progression to the multiplayer open world survival crafting genre.\nUp to 6 players can choose their PhDs, build their scientist, gear up, and explore a massive subterranean complex, filled with supernatural artifacts, transdimensional foes, and science experiments gone awry.\nBetween alien threats hunting their next meal, trigger happy soldiers, and the world’s most advanced robotic security forces attacking personnel working overtime, there’s no shortage of danger. As a scientist, fighting isn’t your forte, so you’ll need to put your PhD to work to outwit your opponents: craft ingenious and outlandish tools, weapons and gear, from simple nets and wooden bats to laser-cannons and elaborate traps - everything your big science brain can muster!\nMake yourself at home - you’re here for the long haul. Scavenge resources from vacant offices and empty labs, raid vending machines, and steal company property to build a new base of operations as you explore the facility. When it’s time for a change of scenery, pack up your belongings and move them across the facility using handcarts, forklifts, SUVs, teleporters, and more.\nDon your lab coat and earn your PhD: from Phytogenetic Botanist to Defense Analyst and Archotechnic Consultant (and many, many more), each with its own advantages essential to survival. Combine traits and skills, then level up to earn perks and abilities with your fellow scientists to forge a formidable scientific force.\nWorking at GATE may have been a dream job, but dying here wasn’t part of your five year plan. Explore this massive underground facility as well as many worlds beyond and take full advantage of the most advanced technology unknown to mankind in this interdimensional sci-fi adventure!",

    "description": "The\nForge of the Chaos Dwarfs\ncampaign pack introduces a new brutal race, the Chaos Dwarfs, into Total War: WARHAMMER III, usable in both the Realm of Chaos and Immortal Empires campaigns.\nExpand, exploit, and dominate the Warhammer world as Astragoth Ironhand, Drazhoath the Ashen, and Zhatan the Black, collectively boasting unique campaign mechanics, objectives, and units that only the evil minds of the Chaos Dwarfs could forge. With their own frightful agenda to pursue, they do not engage with the Ursun storyline in the Realm of Chaos campaign.\n•\tBurn it all down as 3 new Legendary Lords: Astragoth Ironhand, Drazhoath the Ashen, and Zhatan the Black.\n•\tRecruit Gorduz Backstabber to sneak behind your foes as the newest Legendary Hero.\n•\tMaster chaotic magic with the all-new Lore of Hashut. Strike foes down with Hell Hammer or set them ablaze with Burning Wrath.\n•\tConstruct the Great Drill of Hashut to break open Hashut’s domain and siphon his blood for cataclysmic powers.\n•\tCo-operate with your fellow Chaos Dwarfs to obtain District rewards in the Tower of Zharr or usurp others for their Seats in your quest for supremacy.\n•\tCommand a comprehensive army roster of over 26 new units, featuring the baleful Chaos Dwarf war machine trains and the new K’daai Destroyers, alongside some of the Old World’s cruellest infernal warriors.\nAstragoth Ironhand, High Priest of Hashut, is the oldest living Chaos Dwarf Sorcerer-Prophet. Once the most potent sorcerer to walk the Plain of Zharrduk in a thousand years, his powers have begun to wane and his body is slowly succumbing to petrification, negated only by the mechanical device that grants his body movement.\nAs an armoured caster with a mixed spell lore, Astragoth zips around the battlefield at a respectable speed and can hold his own up close.\nDrazhoath the Ashen, Sorcerer Prophet of Hashut, is the Lord of the Black Fortress and commander of the fell Legion of Azgorh. Exiled to the land he now rules, Drazhoath’s mastery of magic and engineering has only grown stronger.\nAs a mighty warrior and a powerful spellcaster, Drazhoath is a nigh unstoppable force, whether he’s splitting skulls on foot or scarring the lands mounted upon Cinderbreath – his Bale Taurus.\nZhatan the Black is the Chaos Dwarf Commander of the Tower of Zharr.\nServing his master Ghorth the Cruel, Zhatan provides him with plentiful Labour and resources to fuel their growing empire whilst meeting his insatiable thirst for sacrifices.\nKnown for his high demand for weaponry, boundless cruelty, and greater stature, Zhatan is a bone-crunching powerhouse.\nWith some of the most unique units in WARHAMMER III to date, the Chaos Dwarfs utilise their engineering prowess with Earthshaker-launching Dreadquake Mortars, Volcanic Magma Cannons, and Daemonic Iron war machines to pull their trains of destruction across the battlefield.\nOn the Daemonic side, set the lands ablaze with the monstrous K’daai Fireborn and K’daai Destroyer units; both bolted with heavy armour to contain a source of disruptive power never before seen in the Mortal World.\nThe Chaos Dwarfs seek an unimaginable power, the Blood of Hashut, to conquer the known world.\nBut they must first construct the Great Drill of Hashut to burrow into the domain of their mighty God, which can only be done by stealing and corrupting a number of precious Dwarfen relics.\nOnce the Great Drill is complete, it can begin to dig to the world's core, churning through earth, rock, and the very fabric of reality itself to breach Hashut's domain.\nBut the Dwarfs hold grudges, seeking revenge for the tainting of their ancient heirlooms, and their aim is to stop you.\nWith a multi-layered economy centred around the gathering and management of labourers, the Chaos Dwarfs capture those that they best in combat and assign them to gruelling work in their Mining Outposts, where they harvest Raw Materials used to expand the Chaos Dwarfen empire, construct advanced buildings, and strengthen their armies.\nWith the Hell-Forge at their disposal, the mighty Chaos Dwarf legions can grow mightier with special schematics forged in fire, and those schematics apply a set of bonuses to the allocated units so they may thrive on the battlefield.\nThe Chaos Dwarfs vie for ownership of special Seats within this mighty Tower, granting their faction unique rewards upon success. Chaos Dwarfs can also cooperate to complete Districts, benefiting the whole culture, or battle it out for specific Seats by usurping each other’s rule.\nThe Chaos Dwarfs are famed arms merchants, supplying the forces of Chaos with weapons, armours, and war machines. By using Convoys, you can trade your tools of war in return for a wide variety of resources.",

They bring new technology in the form of the Nuncio Aquila, anti-grav vox platforms that amplify their commands, overwhelming their weak-willed opponents.\nClad in their iconic carapace armour and wielding potent weapons of oppression, the Arbitrators strike with prodigious force. Muscle forwards with reinforced Assault Shields and a choice of Dominator Maul or Arbites Shotpistol - Darktide’s first defense/range combo. For tougher targets, the Arbites Shotgun packs a unique punch with its Special Issue ammunition.\nThough they consider the Lex Imperialis to be a singular truth, no two enforcers are alike.

    "description": "Another Crab’s Treasure is a soulslike adventure set in a crumbling underwater world. As Kril the hermit crab, you’ll need to wear the trash around you as shells to withstand attacks from enemies many times your size. Embark on an epic treasure hunt to buy back your repossessed shell, and discover the dark secrets behind the polluted ocean.\nIn this undersea society, trash is not only a way of life, but a valuable resource, used for everything from fashion to firearms. But with the presence of trash comes a mysterious infection known as the Gunk, which could spell doom for the entire ocean.\nAs Kril explores the ocean, he'll gain a variety of Umami Techniques—powerful attacks learned from the denizens of the seas. Punch your enemies with the overwhelming might of a Mantis Shrimp, ensnare them with the horrifying Bobbit Worm, and much more.\nThe ocean goes deeper than one can imagine. Fight your way through kelp forests, coral reefs, sand castle cities, and even the unfathomable darkness of the deep-sea trenches, all in the name of getting back your prized shell.\nDesigned to be an approachable experience for newer soulslike players as well as provide a challenge for hardcore fans, Another Crab's Treasure offers something for any level of skill or time commitment. Assist options are provided for those seeking a less frustrating experience, but gluttons for punishment are sure to find the default game a challenge.\nChallenging soulslike-inspired combat\nA grand undersea world to explore\nOver 50 shells to try on and fend off attackers\nA variety of powerful Umami Abilities to smite your enemies\nWay Too Many Crabs",

The infinite procedurally generated world of Necesse is full of mysteries to uncover as you grow your settlement and lead expeditions against pirate kings, dragons, and fallen wizards alike. Will you spend your days crawling through dungeons, searching for treasures and raw materials with which to craft your equipment? Or will you answer the call to adventure, traversing the seas and seeking out great foes to test your prowess? Recruit settlers with particular skills and work alongside them to mine a wide variety of ores, craft gear tailored to your preferred playstyle, and establish a flourishing village.\nPlay singleplayer or co-op - or establish a dedicated server with hundreds of other players. The world is infinite and adapts to whatever mode you choose.\nGrow your settlement from humble beginnings, establishing orchards, farms, and workshops alike. Recruit settlers that can work your fields, tend to your animals, and acquire resources without needing your constant attention and supervision. Use their expertise to help prepare for your next expedition as they expand your settlement's capabilities. Hire guards and craft traps to defend against the many dangers of the world. Sell your wares and use your wealth to trade with neighboring settlements, acquiring much needed equipment well ahead of what would otherwise be possible.\nWhether playing alone or with a few friends, or even creating a dedicated server for hundreds of players, the world of Necesse and its threats adapt to provide a meaningful challenge. Explore freely or take on specific quests as you face off against unique monsters spread across a variety of biomes. Will you be a deadeye archer, a melee champion, or a master of the magical arts? Will you and your friends establish separate competing colonies, or will you pool your resources and divide roles to build a giant settlement together? When faced with a tough boss, will you team up to form a carefully balanced party with powerful synergies, or will you attempt to steal all the glory for yourself?\nCut down trees, mine and process ores, pick herbs, and harvest the bodies of defeated monsters to craft everything from walls and furniture to armor, potions, scrolls, trinkets, and weapons. While some unique equipment can only be acquired by defeating special enemies, everything else can be crafted through a multitude of workshops to equip yourself, your visiting friends, and your loyal settlers. Unlock additional gear as you acquire new resources and discover countless ways to craft, build, and play – endless combinations of equipment means there's always something new to try.\nPlay as you want, customizing difficulty and multiple gameplay rules to fit your preferences. If you don’t like raiders showing up at your settlement, turn them off, and fine-tune gameplay rules like the length of the day/night cycle or the difficulty of boss battles however you like. From pet parrots and penguins to genie lamps, ostrich mounts, and unique outfits, Necesse has countless options to explore. Whether you're playing singleplayer or with friends, and whether you’re cranking up the difficulty or taking it easy, each session is an opportunity to weave an epic tale unlike any that came before it.",

    "description": "Red Barrels invites you to experience mind-numbing terror, this time with friends. Whether you go through the trials alone or in teams, if you survive long enough and complete the therapy, Murkoff will happily let you leave… but will you be the same?\nSet in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control. In a world of distrust, fear, and violence, your morals will be challenged, your endurance tested, and your sanity crushed. All in the name of progress, science, and profit.\nYou’re all prisoners of Murkoff trapped inside their facility. You can choose to complete the trials by yourself or you can tackle them in a team of 2, 3, or 4 players.\nCoop is never forced when it comes to mandatory objectives but working together can be highly beneficial.\nWhatever the number of players in your party, it’s about surviving and getting out.\nUltimately, your goal is to complete Murkoff's therapy and earn the right to be released back into society.  In order to do so, you must complete the Trials and the MK-Challenges.\nTrials are immersive story driven therapies that take a certain time to complete.  Mk-Challenges are shorter therapies occurring in modified or redesigned section of an existing map.\nIn pure Outlast fashion, the core gameplay involves avoiding enemies, hiding from them, and trying to run away. Murkoff will provide tools you can use to increase your stealth capabilities, create opportunities to flee, slow down enemies, and more. However, you will have to earn those tools and work hard to improve them.\nThe tools will allow you to\nStun enemies\nBlind them\nSee through walls\nHeal yourself and people around you.\nMurkoff will ask you to perform disturbing tasks in each trials or mk-challenges.  Only after completing those, will you be allowed to exit the Trials or the MK-Challenges.\nCustomize and create your own trial patient.\nYour cell is your home while you complete the therapy, you can decorate it however you wish.\nChoose your tools, upgrades, and perks to fit your playstyle.\nMeet the Denizens of Murkoff’s Sinyala Facility in The Outlast Trials.  Each one of them will try and help you get through the Trials in one piece! Think you’ll make it?\nYou’ve been abducted by the Murkoff Corporation to undergo unethical experiments that will modify your psyche and behavior throughout the Trials.\nCollect documents and items that will help prove Murkoff’s malpractice against its patients.\nThe Process:\nBreak the Self: Murkoff aims to break down the test subject’s fundamental beliefs. Aspects of self-identity are systematically attacked. Like boot camp or indoctrination, the goal is to force a person to purge themselves of anything held sacred or taboo, the things that limit their behavior. The constant assault on identity, guilt and self-betrayal eventually leads to them breaking down.\nBuild the Self: It’s a bad cop, good cop principle. The rejection of the old ideology leaves a vacuum into which the new ideology can be introduced. As the antithesis of the old ideology, it forms a perfect attraction point as the person flees the old in search of a contrasting replacement.  This progress is accelerated as the new ideology is portrayed as harmonious and ideally suited to the person's needs. Collegiality and calm replaces pain and punishment. Just at the point when the person is fearing annihilation of the self, they are offered a small kindness, a brief respite from the assault on their identity.\nSalvation: Faced with the stark contrast of the pain of the past with the rosy glow of the future that the new ideology presents, the person sheds any the final allegiance to the old ideology, confessing any remaining deep secrets, and takes on the full mantle of the new ideology.  This often feels, and has been described by many, as a form of rebirth. It may be accompanied by rites of passage as the person is accepted and cemented into the new order. The rituals will typically include strong statements made by the person about accepting the new ideology fully and completely, swearing allegiance to its leaders. Saluting flags, kissing other artefacts and other symbolic acts, all solemnly performed, all anchor them firmly in the new ground.\nThe Outlast Trials contain strobing and flashing lights that could cause a small percentage of people to experience seizures when exposed to certain lights, patterns, or images.\nThis game also contains intense violence, gore, graphic sexual content, and strong language. Please enjoy.",

    "description": "Bring retribution to Petrichor V and forge a path to the Colossus to face an ancient threat!\nA Soul, born without purpose, locked away and forgotten. Her prison served as both sanctuary and shackle. Her fate: doomed by her flawless design. Millennia passed. Her desperation grew, and from the depths of her solitude, she brought another into the world she lost. Now, The False Son walks Petrichor V, bound by the betrayal of his forebearer and the corruption of a King’s blind ambition.\nPrepare for an expedition deep into Petrichor V’s lost regions! Ancient Lemurian temples and crashing waterfalls lead the way across new stages. Explore hidden caverns and take in the sulfurous smell of brimstone in the Helminth Hatchery. Fend off scores of Lemurians within their Reformed Altar, or drop into the lush green canopy of the Treeborn Colony.\nBut the true threat towers overhead… Travel the path of the Colossus and ascend its levels in a race to confront The False Son. Defeat him and unlock the true power of his soul!\nThrough her mastery of soul manipulation, Seeker can exact incredible damage on nearby monsters while simultaneously unleashing potent healing to sustain her teammates. This unique combination of brawling and healing defines Seeker as a Survivor. Players who learn to seamlessly flow between these roles will be rewarded with one of the most versatile Survivors to ever grace an escape pod.\nOnce you reach a sufficiently tranquil state, you can even bring fallen allies back to life! Seeker’s presence can turn the tide of any battle, offering both devastation and salvation in equal measure. Embrace duality and lead your team to victory!\nSeeker is instantly unlocked for Seekers of the Storm owners.\nChef has returned! But this isn’t your grandpa’s Chef bot. Years of combat have hard-boiled his soul and perfected his culinary abilities. The long legs of past Chefs have been swapped with a huge roller—perfect for flattening out a nice, tidy pie crust or steamrolling whatever helpless Lemurians were unfortunate enough to wake up this morning.\nThose years of primal culinary misadventures have trained Chef to have incredible control over his trusty cleavers. Hurl them at faraway enemies and call them back to slice and dice with twice the pain. Master the art of the cleaver and filet your way to victory.\nPlayers who cook up something truly delicious will unlock Chef! So, get ready to sauté your way through hordes, blend your combat skills with culinary precision, and serve up some justice… à la mode.\nFree The False Son from his shackles and wield his immense power! This construct, carved in the image of Providence, was forged with the corruption of a hollow king and the heart of a golden titan, making him a formidable rival even to Providence himself.\nThe False Son excels as an immovable object. His massive scale, incredible health, and unmatched regeneration make him a particularly resilient Survivor. In close-range encounters, his hulking club can crush foes into submission. However, outside of clubbing range, fights become far more challenging. Strategically use line of sight to draw enemies in or pick them off with carefully thrown Lunar Spikes. Learn to close in on enemies quickly, and you’ll extract the most out of this imposing golem.\nOnly one player is required to own Seekers of the Storm to enable the expansion for the whole lobby. Players without Seekers of the Storm will be unable to select the new Survivors or permanently unlock new items, logbooks, or other content.",

You decide where to go, whom to hire or to fight, what contracts to take and how to train and equip your men in a procedurally generated open world campaign. Do you have what it takes to lead them through bloody battles and to victory?\nThe game consists of a strategic worldmap and a tactical combat layer. On the worldmap you can freely travel in order to take contracts that earn you good coin, find places worth looting, enemies worth pursuing or towns to resupply and hire men at. This is also where you manage, level up and equip your Battle Brothers. Once you engage a hostile party the game will switch to a tactical map where the actual fighting takes place as detailed turn based combat.\nManage a medieval mercenary company in a procedurally generated open world.\nFight complex turn-based tactical battles with historical equipment and brutal injuries.\nPermadeath. All characters that die in combat will stay dead – unless they return as the undead.\nAll characters come with their own background stories and traits. Want a stuttering ratcatcher, a greedy witch hunter or a drunkard disowned noble?\nCharacter development without a restrictive class-system. Each character gains experience through combat, can level up and acquire powerful perks.\nEquipment that matters. Different weapons grant unique skills – split shields with axes, stun enemies with maces, form a spearwall with spears or crush armor with a warhammer.\nDiverse enemy roster. All enemies have unique equipment, skills and AI behavior.\nA dynamic event system with atmospheric encounters and tough decisions outside of combat.\nThree late game crises – a war between noble houses, a greenskin invasion and an undead scourge – add a looming threat.\nTwo full hours of orchestral soundtrack.\n70 Steam Achievements and Steam Trading Cards.\nOverhype Studios is an independent game developer studio from Hamburg, Germany. We are devoted to making great games that we want to play ourselves. With Battle Brothers we strive to reflect the creativity, complexity and originality from the old days when game developers were passionate gamers, not corporate businessmen. While doing this we took a lot of inspiration from some of the best games out there: The original X-Com, Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat and Jagged Alliance.",

    "description": "Your team of prisoners is dropped into the Rundown when a new Work Order is issued by The Warden, the mysterious entity holding you captive. The Rundown is a series of expeditions, each one taking you deeper into a decayed research facility called The Complex. You descend level by level, scavenging tools and resources that help you survive in a perilous network of tunnels where gruesome creatures lurk in every shadow. Complete all the expeditions to fulfill the Work Order and clear the Rundown.\nGTFO is designed for prisoner teams of four, putting cooperation at the core of the experience. Bots can fill your lineup if you’re short one or two players. They’ll follow you through expeditions, sneak when you sneak, collect resources, and fight alongside you. They’re a good fallback, but the level of communication and tactical combat in GTFO means it’s best to play with people.\nA strategy is necessary to clear the Rundown. Before you drop into The Complex, your team needs to decide what gear, boosters, and weapons to bring. You must also balance the team, identifying the function of each prisoner so that you know what to do when things go wrong. And they will. They always do.\nStealth and coordination are necessary to survive as you maneuver through The Complex. Many of the creatures of GTFO are suspended in a state of hibernation, so light, noise, and vibrations can easily wake up these Sleepers. And if one of them knows you’re there, they all know. That’s when things get messy.\nYou’ll need heavy weaponry and a clear mind when the shit hits the fan. Check your line of fire, force them through bottlenecks, set up your kill zones and reload every chance you get. These creatures stop at nothing, and neither should you. Once the mayhem starts, you have no choice but to put every last one of them down.\nClearing expeditions and Rundowns will reward you with new cosmetic gear. Wear it with pride, as it proves to your peers you’ve been to hell and back. The Sleepers, on the other hand, will not care for a second.",

This will require some dirty work and shady clientele, but you have no other choice, right? When the big boss calls once again, bring a bucket and a mop cause you will really need them. Are you up for the challenge?\nYou need nerves of steel to clean crime scenes left behind by major and minor criminals. You may not have money for your daughter’s hospital stays, but what you do have is a very particular set of skills. With the help of an entire arsenal of equipment, you will clean blood, pack up bodies, and remove any odor. All this under the pressure of a ticking clock and police breathing down your neck.\nDeep Clean\n- Grab your trusty mop and sponge. They will be handy for the majority of the missions. When the mess becomes too much, whip out the powerwasher and clean the outside spaces deeply. Or when the smell is a bit too strong, you have more than just an odor eliminator.\nArm’s Race\n- Sometimes, the equipment you have is not enough and needs an extra oomph. If your lamps or flashlights are not strong enough, get new ones! If there is too much blood outside, get a different set of power washer nozzles! So, before every mission, check the perks available and boost your cleaning arsenal. If you can make your job easier... why not take that opportunity?\nDeep Pockets\n- Make money in any way you can! Mobsters are known for being generous, but sometimes that’s not enough. And certain objects may be too tempting. Who is going to miss this expensive watch? The owner’s already dead.\nIt’s about Family\n- With all the gruesome things you will see and do on every job, you must not forget that you are doing this for her. The life of a single father has its challenges, and you need to overcome them all.\nSo, are you the bad guy? You’re simply a man with the brains and brawn to take fate into his own hands.  You’re the man of the hour, so clean, keep your head down and get that cash.",

    "description": "You play as PMCs guarding a secret research institute in the Republic of Zaslavie.\nThe Scientific Institute for Research of the Zaslavie Exclusion Zone (SIRZEZ) was built before the war to study anomalies and artifacts. Over time, these artifacts became the cause of conflict between international military blocs. Neither side could allow artifacts to fall into enemy hands, ultimately leading to nuclear war.\nA siren sounds — a nuclear bomb is incoming! You have 60 seconds to grab whatever you can and make it to the bunker. Then, the survival begins. Each day, you venture into the Exclusion Zone to scavenge procedurally generated locations: abandoned military bases and research stations, radioactive wastelands, and ruined cities.\nThe Zone is full of secrets and deadly traps, and radiation is far from the only threat.\nYou’ll encounter other survivors ready to kill for food and resources, weird mutated creatures with unique behaviors, and various anomalies.\nNo one knows how exactly anomalies work or their origin. Some phenomena can help you, others will tear you apart. Anomaly areas often hide artifacts — rare, valuable items distorted by anomalies and charged with unique effects.\nThe bunker is your new home.\nExpand it room by room: install generators (gas, solar, or gnome-powered), build crafting stations, grow food, cook meals, and decorate your shelter with whatever you drag back from raids: a table, a dresser, a worn-out sofa, or even a cozy rug. Don’t worry, the previous owners won’t be needing them anymore.\nAfter each raid, you can unwind and chill at the bar in the basement of the institute: have a drink, talk to other survivors, and trade your loot and rare artifacts with the merchant.\nRemember, watch your vitals.\nIn the Zone, people can easily die from hunger, thirst, radiation sickness, or lose their minds and turn on their teammates. Go out looting during the day, and return to bunker before nightfall.\nAnd one last thing: the Zone plays with your mind. Too much stress and you’ll start hearing whispers, seeing things that aren’t there, and feeling someone watching you. Lose your grip, and not even the bunker will save you. Nothing will.\nLife in MISERY isn’t easy.\nBut there’s nothing better than going through it all together.\nExploring bandos with friends, watching each other’s backs, sitting by the fire, drinking whatever’s left, and exhaling smoke into the cold rain — in moments like these, you can feel alive again!",

Feel the satisfaction of simply pressing \"execute\" and watching your drone do all the hard work.\nUnlike most programming games the game isn't divided into distinct levels that you have to complete but features a continuous progression.\nFarming earns you resources which can be spent to unlock new technology.\nProgramming is done in a simple language similar to Python. The beginning of the game is designed to teach you all the basic programming concepts you will need by introducing them one at a time.\nWhile it introduces everything that is relevant, it won't hold your hand when it comes to solving the various tasks in the game. You will have to figure those out for yourself, and that can be very challenging if you have never programmed before.\nIf you are an experienced programmer, you should be able to get through the early game very quickly and move on to the more complex tasks of the later game, which should still provide interesting challenges.\nAlthough the programming language isn't exactly Python, it's similar enough that Python IntelliSense works well with it. All code is stored in .py files and can optionally be edited using external code editors like VS Code. When the \"File Watcher\" setting is enabled, the game automatically detects external changes.",

    "description": "Species: Unknown is a first-person survival horror game, playable in co-op with up to 4 players (private or public servers) or solo. You play as a mercenary sent aboard an abandoned spaceship. Your job? Execute high-risk contracts, make it out alive, and claim your reward. But keep in mind that you’re not alone.\nSomething is hunting you…\nForm a squad of up to 4 players to take on different contracts with escalating difficulty. Each mission plays differently depending on your objective, your teammates, the map and which of the 5 intelligent threats is stalking you.\nNo one survives alone, but you can try.\nEvery contract drops you into a different nightmare. Whether you're tasked with extracting a black box, capturing or eliminating an unknown threat, or even destroying the ship to prevent the creature from escaping… Each mission demands a specific strategy and none of them are easy.\nThe specimen is chosen procedurally from a growing roster of terrifying monsters. Each one comes with distinct behaviors, hunting patterns, strengths, and weaknesses. You’ll need to investigate your surroundings to gather vital clues and identify the threat in order to proceed smoothly (or not).\nDo your job and get rewarded, or die without anyone knowing.\nStrategize as a group, make smart use of your tools that can turn the tide, if only for a moment:\nMotion Tracker\n: Detect nearby movement and prepare for what's coming\nShield\n: Block deadly attacks and buy time for your team\nHealth Syringe\n: Heal yourself or allies in the heat of battle\nMini-Map\n: Navigate pitch-black corridors with real-time positional data\nGuns won’t always save you. Some threats are too resistant or simply untouchable. But the right weapon, found at the right time, can help you push through or even take the creature down.\nThe higher the risk, the higher the reward. Completing contracts earns you credits you can use to:\nUpgrade your gear\nBuy new tools\nCustomize your appearance\nGather lore and build your own creature museum",

    "description": "Build your own ship and travel across the planet! Land anywhere you want to hunt for treasure, harvest food and fuel, and bring back souvenirs like exotic birds, long-forgotten gravtech, or a gold-plated charge rifle.\nYour gravship starts small - just a grav engine, a few rooms, and enough chemfuel to lift off. But over time, it will become a home: a travelling colony of labs, living quarters, workshops, and anything else your colonists need.\nCollect rare gravcores to expand your gravship and travel further. You’ll find them in crashlanded orbital platforms, insect-infested caves, broken-down reactors rigged with traps, and other dangerous locations.\nExplore new biomes and landmarks\nIn the\nglowforest\n, bioluminescent mushrooms and psychedelic spores glow in the permanent darkness. Geothermal vents belch sulfur. Normal plants can’t grow here - you’ll need to survive on fungi alone.\nThe\nscarlands\nare the war-torn remains of once-thriving cities. Craters rupture the roads, vents release heat and gas, and toxic rain pours constantly. Mechanoids stalk the ruins and the only surviving animals are dangerous mutants.\nThe\ngrasslands\nare a ranching cowpoke’s dream: endless fields of golden fertile land. While trees are rare here, the growing seasons are long and bountiful, and strong winds guarantee power for your turbines. However, drought can strike at any time and many farms have been lost to the raging brushfires.\nThe\nglacial plains\nfeel prehistoric: blizzards smother the land, herds of mastodons roam, and scimitar cats prowl the frozen expanse. Carve shelters into walls of ice, or seek refuge among the buried frozen ruins and live as the old ones did.\nThe\nlava fields\nnever stay still. Rivers of molten rock flow across the land in sudden bursts, swallowing up animals, buildings, and colonists alike. Volcanic debris crashes down from the sky, and thick ash makes it hard to breathe. Stay safe by building barriers to divert incoming lava and wear cloth masks to protect your lungs.\nThe new\nlandmarks system\ncombines with new biomes to create endless landscape variation.\nDig a sprawling colony into the rockface of\ncliffs, chasms, crevasses, and valleys\nfor natural defenses - an undergrounder’s dream!\nBuild a coastal fishing village atop heavy bridges by settling on\nislands, archipelagos, atolls, peninsulas, and fjords\n.\nTake over\nabandoned colony buildings\nand repurpose them for your own base.\nRaid\nancient structures\nfor resources like chemfuel, weapons, components, minerals, and more.\nSurvive beyond the atmosphere\nFly your gravship into orbit! Land on collapsed orbital platforms, ore-rich asteroids, and hollowed-out satellites. Search through the debris for treasure, but be prepared for a fight with other orbital scavengers. Mechanoid wrecks promise advanced gravtech and resources for your ship, if you can make it past their ancient, inhuman defenses.\nSpace is a harsh place, so build your ship to survive. Airtight walls protect your colonists and their pets from the vacuum of space. Heaters keep the interiors warm, while oxygen pumps provide life support. Build airlocks with vac barriers to prevent depressurization of the ship, and equip spacefaring colonists with vac suits before they exit into the void.\nCute, terrifying, and intelligent wildlife\nOdyssey adds over 40 new animals that can be tamed, trained, traded, or eaten. Watch your colorful flock of sparrows and bluebirds take flight, raise a hunting pack of scimitar cats and great wolves, go swimming with seals and otters, or just keep the cutest ones as pets, like porcupines and prairie dogs.\nAnimals are more than just companions - they nuzzle your colonists to comfort them, they dig and forage for resources, and they’ll hunt down your foes. Even creatures with simpler minds can be trained by injecting them with a sentience catalyst - turning even the humble hermit crab into a vigilant protector.\nYou can also go fishing! Bring home big catches like tuna, marlin, and more unusual finds.\nQuests across the planet and beyond\nYou'll discover quests from ancient maps, passing visitors, and anonymous signals.\nTrack down the mythical\nalpha thrumbo\nby following its herd across the wilderness. If you can bring it down, its priceless, razor-sharp horn is yours.\nRaid\nancient mercenary crypts\nwhere the soldiers have recently awoken from cryptosleep. They  guard glitterworld supplies, and the gang leader owns a valuable weapon that could be yours.\nAbandoned\norbital platforms\nand derelict\nsatellites\ndrift through low orbit. They promise stockpiles of loot, but you’re competing with hostile salvage crews. Sometimes orbital fugitives hole up in the wreckage. There are also defensive turrets, traps, and leftover mechanoids.\nAsteroid mines\noffer rich veins of plasteel, uranium, and gold, but they’re vulnerable to pirates and debris from space. Get in and get out, fast.\nAnd more!\nNew weapons, traps, and enemies\nA new\nunique weapon system\nlets you arm your colonists with special weapons they find - a sawed-off shotgun clears the room in a second, an AI-assisted rifle scope makes the worst shooter accurate, and a fully golden revolver just looks cool.\nNew gear helps with new threats. Hunter drones chase their targets and explode on contact. Wasp drones jab their prey with paralyzing needles. Ancient sentries patrol ruins with a scattergun to blast apart intruders. The cyclops mechanoid barrages enemies with shield-piercing gamma beams. And deep below, the insect hive queen stirs among her chittering spawn.\nThe machine hive mind\nFar above the planet, the mechhive pulses with hate. Its mechanoids reproduce endlessly, and they will never stop attacking until every human on the planet is dead. When you reach the inhuman mind behind this terror, you face a choice. Will you destroy it and shut down every mechanoid for good - or take control of its power?\nThis expansion includes a new album by Alistair Lindsay, composer of the RimWorld soundtrack.",

John, awoken by the kidnapping of his neighbor, sets out into the night to fight back against the demonic invasion and rescue his friends before it's too late...\nTake control of John as his adventure leads him through an hour-by-hour experience of what could be everyone's last night on Earth. As John, you will encounter unearthly evils, Demon lords, afflicted townsfolk, high school bullies, and a torrent of engaging, serial-like side stories – all nested in a larger-than-life fantasy that brings the ultimate evil to a neighborhood near you.\nChoose your class, customize your abilities, and battle nightmarish creatures as you collect unique gear in order to infiltrate the massive lairs of Demon lords that have taken over the town.\nTake down the town’s demons as you get closer to unraveling Baphomet’s grip on Miami. Explore the entire map of the town, interact with a wide cast of NPCs and take on the Demon Generals in the order that you wish.\nChoose from 5 different classes: Barbarian, Knight, Rogue, Necromancer and Sorcerer. Each class excels differently, providing a unique play style depending on your choice. The class you choose decides your base style, while the skill trees allow for further customization.\nSkill trees are split into three branches, containing 10 different talents each. As you level up, spend allotted points into any of the three branches of your class. Once you have reached level 10 in your first branch, you are free to cross over into another branch, allowing you to fully customize your play style.\nOutfit yourself with new equipment via quest rewards, hidden items throughout the town, and scoring random drops from a multi-tiered loot system with variable drop rates. Items range from common to completely unique. The items you collect provide an extra dimension to character stat development and have special abilities that will make you even more powerful.\nYou don’t have to face the forces of darkness by yourself. In Kingdom of Night, either play through the campaign as John alone, or with a friend in local co-op. Team up and synergize different character classes, becoming a torrent of annihilation that the underworld will fear.",

    "description": "Dear Applicant,\nI am pleased to offer you the role of Apprentice Thaumaturge at Strange Antiquities.\nYou show promise – a sharp mind and a strong stomach – exactly what this work demands. I need you to run the shop while I attend to other pressing matters. You will need a keen eye for detail as you provide the townsfolk of Undermere with occult objects for their arcane needs.\nUndermere might seem unassuming at first – a serene little town on the edge of a grand lake. But it also sits at the edge of our world and the world beyond – and it falls on us to preserve reality’s frayed edge.\nPermit me now to outline your duties – you’ll need to be up to speed from day one.\nEvery day, you will welcome new customers into the cosy, candle-lit interior of the shop. Their needs are unpredictable and often alarming, but never dull!\nStudy and Identify:\nExamine, identify and catalogue strange artefacts. Observation, deduction, and careful reference to our collection of illustrated tomes will serve you well. Mistakes can be… costly.\nHelp… Or Hinder:\nWhen dealing with powerful items, your choices matter. Will you help someone with their problem, or curse them with a horrid affliction? In a small town like this, people remember your misdeeds.\nExplore and Discover:\nFrom time to time, you will have to leave the safety of the shop. Whether investigating rumours or retrieving artefacts, my well-loved hand-drawn maps will guide you to where you need to go.\nSolve and Uncover:\nYour day-to-day might already feel like a puzzle, but this store holds many more. Few know how old this building is, and fewer still know what secrets lie within its walls.\nTending the Familiar:\nAnd, of course, Jupiter, the shop’s cat, demands daily affection. In return for his company, please oblige him with the occasional scratch behind the ears.\nThese ravens are an omen. There is a sickness in this town and I intend to investigate it.\nBarton Potter told me that his bad eye has been aching again. That can’t be a good sign. And a creeping dark has set up in Jack Hungerford’s house. I have business in Ravenglass but I will consult with the occult scholar, Verona Green, before I leave.\nThere are always forces at play that would see our beloved Undermere\nunmade\n. We stand between them and the threshold. If events take a turn, you may be called upon to take a stand.\nThis shop is my life’s work. And, for the most part, it has been good to me. May it now offer you equal parts reward and mystery! But remember: some curiosities are best left untouched, and some visitors are not what they seem.\nI look forward to your arrival.\nYours,\nEli White\nThaumaturge & Proprietor\nStrange Antiquities, Undermere\nPurveyors of the Arcane since 1683\nWe are two brothers from the UK who have been making games together for over a decade. In 2022, we released our occult puzzle game Strange Horticulture, and the response has been incredible; from amazing reviews and award nominations to appearing in numerous best-of-the-year lists. Most importantly, it has been a joy to read the kind words left by so many of our players on Steam, where we are still rated Overwhelmingly Positive after close to 12,000 reviews!\nStrange Antiquities\nis not a sequel, not a direct one, at least. You’ll see some familiar faces, and maybe some plants will pop up, but it’s a brand new story. If you have a fondness for\nStrange Horticulture\nand the dark, but welcoming world we’ve created, know that you’ll feel right at home.\nWe want to thank everyone who has played Strange Horticulture, left us a review, told their friends, or supported the game in any way. It has been an amazing journey and we can't wait to share the next chapter with you.\nMany thanks,\nRob & John\nPlease wishlist and follow Strange Antiquities to stay up-to-date with the development and help us spread the word.",

These Lords may be used in WARHAMMER III’s Realm of Chaos and Immortal Empires campaigns. However, they feature their own campaign mechanics and objectives, and do not engage with the Ursun storyline in the Realm of Chaos campaign.\nOver time, players can choose to elevate lowly mortal units, such as Marauders, through the Chaos ranks to become powerful servants of the dark gods, such as mighty Chaos Knights and Chosen. Chaos Lords and Heroes may also be elevated all the way to Daemon Prince status, and even dedicated to the service of one of the Dark Gods.\n•\t4 new Legendary Lords to experience...\n•\t...each with a suite of new Chaos-themed campaign mechanics\n•\tThe Champions of Chaos are playable in Immortal Empires and the Realm of Chaos campaign\n•\tOver 50 new battlefield units\nYou can choose your Champion under Warriors of Chaos to start your new campaign.\nThe consort of Khorne himself, Valkia the Bloody descends from the skies to slaughter in the name of the Blood God. Valkia uses a variant of Khorne's Bloodletting feature, with rewards better-suited to the Gorequeen's needs. Her faction also gains campaign movement bonuses following successful battle victories.\nFestus was once a skilled doctor. Compassionate to a fault, he traded his soul and sanity for the knowledge to save others. No longer bound by morality, the Leechlord brews Plagues in Nurgle’s name. He must attain ingredients through different methods than his Daemonic counterparts, but his concoctions are no less potent.\nAzazel's beauty is said to be second only to his patron Slaanesh. Most opponents concede before the fight even begins… for how could they wish harm upon such an enchanting being? Such is Azazel's beauty, he can utilise elements of Slaanesh's Seduction to tempt enemies to join his side pre-battle. Those he defeats bear his unique symbol: the Mark of Azazel.\nThe malformed sorcerer-twin Vilitch uses his potent magical abilities in tandem with his brother’s hulking form to enslave those who would oppose him.\nVilitch can use a variant of the Changing of the Ways like his Tzeentch allies, and begins play with the ability to Teleport Attack his foes.",

    "description": "Ivalice—a kingdom blessed by the light of the gods and ruled by the Two-headed Lion. A year after her defeat to Ordallia in the Fifty Years' War, the king succumbed to malady, leaving a mere boy of two to ascend the throne.\nWhoever was named regent would rule in truth, and thus emerged two rival candidates: dukes Goltanna and Larg, whose deeds during the war had earned them great renown. Goltanna the Black Lion and Larg the White Lion were destined to clash, and the resulting conflict would come to be known as the War of the Lions.\nAgainst this backdrop appear Ramza, third son of House Beoulve, one of Ivalice's leading military families, and his childhood companion Delita, a commoner raised amongst nobles. As they endeavor to chart a course through this tumultuous age, a mighty current draws them ever closer to the abyss.\nLead your party in exhilarating encounters where strategic positioning and forward planning determine the outcome. Use the varied terrain of 3D battlefields to your advantage, skillfully manipulate the turn order, and victory will be yours for the taking.\nCombine a wide variety of jobs and abilities to craft your very own strategies.\nAs your party members grow, they will gain access to more jobs, each with its own unique abilities. Once learned, abilities can be used even after changing to another job. With over 20 jobs to master—including white mage, black mage, dragoon, and many others from the FINAL FANTASY series—and hundreds of abilities to learn, you have the freedom to experiment and discover the combinations that best suit your party. Chocobos and other creatures can also be tamed and led into battle.\nWith improved graphics, fully voiced dialogue, and refined gameplay, the enhanced version provides the perfect way to immerse yourself in the world of Ivalice. Along with the fine-tuning of several features and battle mechanics, the inclusion of the more accessible \"Squire\" difficulty setting makes the enhanced version an excellent starting point for first-time players.\nThe classic version unites the graphics and gameplay of the original 1997 version with the renowned War of the Lions translation for a unique way to experience this beloved title.\nThe Enhanced version of the game supports a wide variety of controller options.\nIt also supports keyboard and mouse controls.\nThe Classic version of the game only supports XInput controllers.\nKeyboard controls are also supported, but mouse controls are not supported.",

With dynamic real-time battles and incredible turn-based empire management, will you rise to become Egypt’s last great Pharaoh, or a conquering Great King of the Hittites? Or will you take command of the Sea Peoples’ bloodthirsty hordes and drive the Bronze Age Collapse?\nWith the Bronze Age Collapse looming and the dark sails of the  Sea Peoples filling the horizon the people of Egypt cry out for a new leader. Many desire the power of the throne, but the path to becoming Pharaoh is a perilous one. Unearth a breathtakingly vibrant recreation of the Bronze Age Collapse as you battle societal disarray, face natural disasters and fight to protect your people against waves of invaders.\nEnemy armies aren’t the only challenges to overcome on the battlefield. Lead your soldiers through sudden and dramatic shifts in weather, such as torrential rain and sandstorms, and witness the tides of battle turn as it directly impacts the surrounding terrain. Beware the threat of fire too, as battles can become engulfed in flames, striking and spreading across the battlefield as it burns forests and damages the foundations of enemy settlements.\nProve your legitimacy to become Pharaoh, Great King of the Hittites, or command the invasion of the Sea Peoples, and expand your growing empire on a campaign map that spans the rich cultural hubs of Egypt, Canaan and Anatolia. With a choice of ten Faction Leaders, step into their unique playstyles and take charge of diverse unit rosters. Whether you’re charming the courts as a peerless diplomat, charging into battle as an unwavering commander or causing chaos as a fearless warlord, become a leader that history will remember.\nOn your journey to becoming Pharaoh, uncover a beautifully lush and vibrant recreation of ancient Egypt at the height of its power. From the fertile banks of the river Nile to the windswept, arid deserts of the Sinai Peninsula and the mountainous crags of ancient Anatolia, this magnificent visual reimagining brings the beauty and brutality of Egypt’s most tumultuous era to life.\nWith a brand-new Campaign Customisation feature, no two campaigns will ever feel the same. Determine how you play with an extended range of campaign customisation options, such as random starting positions for all factions, detailed resource settings, the ability to toy with natural disasters and much more.

    "description": "Fireteam is a PvE tactical shooter game mode for up to five players that condenses the core essence of the Squad experience into shorter, replayable missions. Communication, teamwork, and coordination remain vital to mission success in Fireteam. However, rather than playing on teams of 50 in matches of 100 players, the focus is on quicker missions of varying objectives for smaller teams.\nThere are four free missions available to all Squad players\n, with additional paid missions for those who choose to purchase either the Supporter or Founder packs.\nLooking for a few quick rounds of intense military gameplay? With Fireteam, there’s no waiting in server queues and no need to sort by ping. Matchmaking is done via peer-to-peer connection with friends. Choose to host a game, or join a friend’s.\nWhile Squad is known for its larger teams of 50 soldiers, Fireteam distills the experience for up to 5 players. This makes more room for experimentation, providing a lower-stakes environment for learning roles, practicing squad leading, and trying new tactics with less pressure. Tighter, condensed missions allow you to hop in and play again and again. Got a strategy you’d like to test before heading into a full game of Squad? Wanting to experiment with a new kit or thinking about giving Squad Leader a go? Try it out in Fireteam first.\nSquad is a game of immeasurable depth and complexity. For Fireteam, we sought to create an experience welcoming new players not only to Squad, but also the genre. Objectives are clearly defined from the onset, regardless of which mission type you find yourself playing. This also makes Fireteam an ideal starting point for players interested in learning more about the broader scope of Squad. While welcoming to newcomers, Fireteam is also a refreshing new way to play Squad, even for seasoned players. Don’t have the hours to commit to longer campaigns, but are still looking for intense military combat on a smaller scale? Boot up a few rounds of Fireteam and get your fix.\nLike Squad, Fireteam will benefit from content updates throughout the year. Fireteam will continue to grow, with ongoing mission expansions, new tools and improvements for modders, community-created content, and a living roadmap shaped directly by your feedback. In addition to the four missions available to everyone at launch, the paid upgrades to Fireteam are as follows:\nSupporter Pack: $7.99 USD\n(pricing may vary depending on your region). Access to the 9 paid missions available at launch, in addition to access to the free missions tier. This pack is the straightforward, no-nonsense tier. You get all the missions at launch.\nFounder Pack\n:\n$14.99 USD\n(\nLimited Time Offer\n- pricing may vary depending on your region). Leave your mark on Squad! Access to all the missions available at launch (the same access as Supporter Pack). As a Founder, you will get an exclusive weapon skin, an exclusive emote, and have a hand in creating a future, exclusive weapon skin voted on by the community.\nSumari Search and Destroy (3 players)\n- Fight through hostile territory behind enemy lines to find and destroy key enemy targets before withdrawing to safety.\nMutaha Combined Arms (5 players)\n- Hunt down enemy mortar bases in a fortified city, coordinate between your squad's armoured vehicle and dismounted infantry to reach your objective.\nFallujah Search and Destroy (5 players)\n- With a convoy of light vehicles, break through enemy lines to reach and overrun a heavily defended ammunition depot.\nNarva Extraction (5 players)\n- Shot down over hostile territory, your squad must fight to reach friendly lines before ammo runs out and enemy patrols close in.\nCombined Arms\n- Hunt down enemy mortar bases in a fortified area, coordinate with armored vehicles and dismounted infantry to clear obstacles and reach your objective.\nOn Harju\nSearch and Destroy\n- Cross the frontline and fight through hostile territory to overrun and destroy key enemy targets.\nOn Narva (Castle)\nOn Mutaha\nOn Narva\nExtraction\n- Shot down over enemy territory near the frontline, your squad must fight to reach friendly lines before ammo runs out and enemy patrols close in.\nOn Mutaha\nOn Fallujah\nVehicle Hunt\n- Cross the frontline and fight through hostile territory to destroy enemy armor.\nOn Mutaha\nOn Fallujah\nOn Narva\nNew missions will be added to Fireteam in early 2026. Two of them will be free and available to all Squad players, with two additional paid missions available to those who purchase either Supporter or Founder packs.",

Every detail is designed for interactivity—you can pick up and examine objects, wipe away dirt, drive vehicles, take a seat wherever you like, and move anything that’s not bolted down.\nCreate your dream escape rooms with the updated Room Editor 2.0! After seeing over 4,000 rooms built in the first game, we’ve made the tools even more powerful and intuitive. The new lighting engine makes your rooms look more like the official rooms, the Building Editor lets you design rooms (with working stairs!), and you can bring everything to life with Sequence animations.\nWhy a sequel?\nA sequel gives us a fresh start and lets us push the limits of the genre further. We were inspired to explore darker escape room themes and experiment with new gameplay and puzzle ideas. Splitting from the original game let us focus on improving key features like rendering, networking, physics, and animations.\nWill Escape Simulator still get updates?\nYes! With the recent Mayan DLC and more content on the way, we’ll continue supporting the original game while expanding its reach to new platforms.\nIs it scary?\nWhile\nEscape Simulator 2\nis darker and has a more mysterious vibe, it’s not a horror game. The game also doesn’t feature any jump scares or gore.\nWe’d love to hear your thoughts and ideas for\nEscape Simulator 2\n!

Ragdoll physics turn every moment into a potential comedy highlight.\nKeep your guests happy by setting up food stands and vending machines around your park. Prepare hot dogs, lemonade, ice cream and more! The better the treats, the happier the visitors.\nEverything you do affects your park’s overall rating from how clean it is, to how fun your slides are, to the quality of your food and amenities. The happier your guests are, the better your rating. Keep them satisfied and they’ll stay longer, spend more, and want to come back.\nAs your park gets more popular, it’s time to expand.

    "description": "Cities: Skylines\nis a modern take on the classic city simulation. The game introduces new game play elements to realize the thrill and hardships of creating and maintaining a real city whilst expanding on some well-established tropes of the city building experience. You’re only limited by your imagination, so take control and reach for the sky!\nConstructing your city from the ground up is easy to learn, but hard to master. Playing as the mayor of your city you’ll be faced with balancing essential requirements such as education, water electricity, police, fire fighting, healthcare and much more along with your citys real economy system. Citizens within your city react fluidly, with gravitas and with an air of authenticity to a multitude of game play scenarios.\nColossal Order's extensive experience developing the Cities in Motion series is fully utilized in a fully fleshed out and well-crafted local traffic simulation.\nBe more than just an administrator from city hall. Designating parts of your city as a district results in the application of policies which results in you rising to the status of Mayor for your own city.\nThe city changes during the hours of the day and affects citizen schedules. Traffic is visibly slower at night and some zoned areas do not work with full efficiency. Cities: Skylines will put you in control of managing the different aspects of the day and night cycles.\nBuild or improve on existing maps and structures. You can then import your creations into the game, share them as well as download the creations of other city builders on the Steam workshop.",

    "description": "You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.\nThe wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.\nFoxes, beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?\nExperience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?\nWith hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.\nLaying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.",

    "description": "Subnautica is an underwater adventure game set on an alien ocean planet. A massive, open world full of wonder and peril awaits you!\nYou have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to go is down. Subnautica's oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio-luminescent underwater rivers. Manage your oxygen supply as you explore kelp forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful.\nAfter crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft diving gear, lights, habitat modules, and submersibles. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items.\nBuild bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore the vast ocean.\nWhat happened to this planet? Signs abound that something is not right. What caused you to crash? What is infecting the sea life? Who built the mysterious structures scattered around the ocean? Can you find a way to make it off the planet alive?\nThe ocean teems with life: Use the ecosystem to help you. Lure and distract a threatening creature with a fresh fish, or simply swim as fast as you can to avoid gnashing jaws of roaming predators.\nBuild a Pressure Re-Active Waterproof Nanosuit, or PRAWN Suit, and explore extreme depth and heat. Modify the suit with mining drills, torpedo launchers, propulsion cannons, grappling hooks and more.\nAs the sun goes down, the predators come out. The ocean is unforgiving of those caught unprepared in the darkness. Areas that are safe to explore during the day become treacherous at night, but also reveal a beauty that those who hide from the darkness will never see.\nCave systems wind below the sea bed, from dark claustrophobic passages to caverns lit by bio-luminescent life and burning-hot lava flows. Explore the world below the ocean floor, but watch your oxygen levels, and take care to avoid the threats lurking in the darkness.\nSubnautica is being created by Unknown Worlds, a small studio founded by Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire that traces its roots back to the 2003 Half-Life mod Natural Selection. The team is scattered around the globe, from the United States to the United Kingdom, France, the Czech Republic, Russia, Thailand, Australia, and many more places. There is a central office in San Francisco, California that serves as home base for the whole team.\nThis game contains flashing lights that may make it unsuitable for people with photosensitive epilepsy or other photosensitive conditions.

    "description": "Play the digital adaptation of the beloved tabletop board game.\nRoot\nis a game of adventure and war where 2 to 4 players battle for control of a vast wilderness.\nThe nefarious\nMarquise de Cat\nhas seized the great woodland, intent on harvesting its riches. Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This\nAlliance\nwill seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering\nVagabonds\nwho are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance’s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.\nMeanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling\nEyrie\nhave found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright.\nThe stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root.\nThe most recent conquerors of the forest, the\nMarquise de Cat\nplays a game of engine building and logistics while policing the vast wilderness. By collecting Wood they are able to build Workshops, Sawmills, and Recruiters to help her score victory points. Marquise de Cat has the largest army in ROOT, but numbers alone won’t be enough to secure the forest...\nThe Marquise de Cat builds a mighty industrial war machine to subdue the forest. Each time the Marquise builds a Workshop, Sawmill, or Recruiter, you score victory points. The more of the same building she has on the map, the more points scored. However, to fuel ongoing construction, the Marquise must maintain and protect a strong, interconnected economy of Wood. While it may be tempting to overwhelm your opponents with sheer numbers, this leaves you at great risk of spreading yourself too thin and ultimately not being able to keep up.\nThe\nEyrie Dynasties\nonce ruled the wood, before the coming of the Cats. They must retake control by capturing territory and building Roosts before they collapse back into squabbling. The Eyrie are proud and bound to the decrees of their leaders. Each leader brings with them different specialties and advantages. The right leader at the right time could lead you to victory, but the wrong leader could cripple your chances of reclaiming the forest.\nDuring the Evening, the Eyrie score victory points based on the number of roosts on the map. The greater their presence in the Woodlands, the greater their gains. However, the Eyrie are bound by their Decree, an ever-increasing set of mandated actions promised by their leader. Each turn, they must take all of the actions on their Decree, or else fall into turmoil.\nThe\nWoodland Alliance\ndoesn’t take kindly to despots - old or new. Marquise, Eyrie, they’re all the same. Only through the will of the people can this wood be ruled! The Woodland Alliance are masters of guerrilla warfare, they begin slowly but can build into a late-game powerhouse - but only if they can manage to subvert the other would-be rulers along the way.\nThe Woodland Alliance works to gain the sympathy of the various creatures of the forest. Each time the Alliance places a sympathy token, they may score victory points. The more sympathy on the map they have, the more victory points they score. Gaining the sympathy of the people requires supporters. These supporters can also be put toward violent ends, inciting outright rebellion across the forest. When a revolt erupts, the Alliance will establish a base. Bases allow the Alliance to train officers, increasing their military strength and flexibility.\nThe\nVagabond\nis an adventurer to some, a trader to others, and thief to more, and an all-around scoundrel. As the Vagabond, you will explore all over the map, beyond just it's clearings, into dense woods to find items and ruins. You can trade and lend aid to the warring factions of the forest to help you complete your own secret quests.\nThe Vagabond plays all sides of the conflict while going on quests to increase his renown throughout the wood. Each time the Vagabond improves their relationship with another faction, or removes a warrior belonging to a faction hostile toward them, the Vagabond scores victory points. You can also complete quests to score victory points. To move and act effectively the Vagabond must manage a pack of items, expand your selection by exploring the forest ruins and providing aid to other factions.",

A mighty leader to some, and a bloated corpse-worm to others, those that stand against Tamurkhan quickly fall under the banner of this bringer of desolation.\nAs a hard-hitting tank with the strength of an Ogre and the vigour of Nurgle’s greatest combatants, Tamurkhan rides into battle atop his unique Toad Dragon, Bubebolos, to unleash rot on any that dare oppose the Warlord.\nTamurkhan’s crusade across the land is not merely one of destruction or decay, for he amasses a horde of heroic characters as he goes, absorbing the many strengths of those that could not defeat him. These heroic characters, Chieftains, are added to his ever-growing empire once Tamurkhan has displayed his true dominating power, granting the Maggot Lord a suite of champions and warriors for use in his grand crusade.\nWith enough devoted Chieftains under his wing, Tamurkhan can pursue ultimate victory.",

Think again. The Mascots are all living, breathing, fully formed personalities, with dreams, fears, and the occasional breakdowns of their own- just like us! Whether it’s\nTrororo\n, a charming cat who’s a little too obsessed with \"adult video\" or sweet, silken\nTo-Fu\n, who can’t stop sobbing, your job is to befriend, mentor, and (hopefully) get these mascots to finish their jobs without causing a major catastrophe.\nSending your mascots out to work is never as easy as it sounds. One minute they’re promoting delicious food, the next they’re stuck in a doorway or starting a kitchen inferno. Need help? Good thing Kaso-Machi is full of intrepid everyday heroes ready to lend a hand (if you’ve managed to befriend them, of course).

This nifty little ride may look like a heap of junk, but with a few tweaks, it’ll have\nnitro boosts\n,\nglider wings\n, and even the ability to\nlaunch Pinky☆ - Michi’s maniacal mascot assistant - like a missile\n. Use your truck to explore the strange, forgotten town, unlock collectibles, and uncover hidden mysteries. Who knew a Kei Truck could be your best friend in a town where literally everything else hates you?!\nExiled after an ambush that left his clan in shambles, Michi finds himself piecing together the mystery of what really happened, while the town seems to actively conspire against him. Nightmare spirits seem a little too interested in your business, and there’s an ever-present sense that something’s very, very wrong in this place…\nThink you can resist? Think again. The mascots know where you live. Step into the world of Promise Mascot Agency and claim your place in this brave new world of mascot domination.",

    "description": "Lossless Scaling is a powerful tool that enhances your gaming experience by making games smoother with LSFG frame generation and optionally improving quality or performance with various scaling algorithms and machine learning models like LS1. It's compatible with most games, even those that don't have built-in frame generation or scaling, as well as with other applications and a wide range of hardware.\nThis feature creates additional frames to make games look smoother. It’s perfect for games that lack a built-in solution or require new hardware, as well as for older games and emulators with a locked frame rate.\nLSFG is a proprietary machine learning model developed from scratch specifically for Lossless Scaling and has received several significant updates.\nIt’s compatible with a wide range of hardware and has a separate performance model for low-power GPUs.\nThe Fixed mode allows you to multiply the original frame rate, while the Adaptive mode lets you specify a desired frame rate that may not be a multiple of the original.\nScaling allows you to improve performance by lowering the original resolution and applying upscaling to recover some of the quality. It's also great for older games and pixel art games that don’t support modern resolutions or fullscreen mode.\nLS1, FSR, NIS are well-suited for modern games.\nInteger, XBR are ideal for pixel art games.\nAnime4K is great for cartoons or anime.\nA great feature of Lossless Scaling is the ability to offload computations to a second GPU. This means applying frame generation or scaling won't affect the game's original frame rate and may reduce latency.\nThe community has found Lossless Scaling to be safe to use with online games that have built-in anti-cheat systems. However, this cannot be guaranteed and should be used with user discretion.\nLossless Scaling provides extensive configuration options through Game Profiles, allowing you to save per-game or grouped settings. Profiles eliminate the need for repetitive manual adjustments by automatically applying your chosen settings and scaling whenever the game executable is detected, ensuring consistent and automated operation.\nOnly windowed and borderless fullscreen modes are supported. Exclusive fullscreen mode may work only if the Lossless Scaling output is configured for a second display.\nFree GPU resources are preferred, otherwise Lossless Scaling will affect the game's original frame rate.\nWindows 10, version 2004 or newer.\nThe LSFG feature of Lossless Scaling is available on Linux as a community-driven port.

They each possess their own iconic item: a bow for Low and a wrench for Alone. Working together, they’ve become adept at sneaking through hidden passages, hoisting each other over massive obstacles, and watching each other’s backs. Whether you’re playing with a friend or an A.I. companion, you’ll depend on each other's iconic items to create opportunities and to progress. The environment is full of clues and possibilities for imaginative children to exploit. Low’s arrows can reach high targets, cut through ropes, or down flying enemies, and Alone’s wrench is just the thing for crushing stunned enemies, smashing through barriers, or manipulating the workings of massive machines.\nNo matter where you go, the Nowhere is home to horrific monsters. These Residents won't hesitate to go out of their way to capture any intrusive little Visitors that draw their attention. You might find yourself playing a terrifying game of hide and seek with Monster Baby in the sandy ruins of the Necropolis, struggling to avoid swarms of voracious Candy Weevils in an unsetlling Candy Factory, or dodging heavy feet while running along the rain-soaked promenade of a filthy funfair. You'll need to be ready to run, hide, or even defend yourself at a moment's notice to stay in one piece.\nDon’t be too distracted by the desolate beauty of the Nowhere. There are dark mysteries waiting for you as Low and Alone follow their mirror path across the Spiral. As each new location will become more dangerous and disturbing than the last, traumatic flashes from the past will begin to emerge.

For millennia, The Void Creatures have grown dominant by taking artifacts from our realm to theirs. Now they look to add you to their collection.\nBring your friends on the adventure! Only one player is required to own Survivors of the Void to enable the monsters, levels, and items to appear in-game for the whole lobby. Players without Survivors of the Void will be unable to select the two new survivors or permanently unlock new items, logbooks, or other content.\nPress your advantage on the high ground. Unleash devastating shots from across the map with Railgunner’s first-person scope. Time your reloads, aim for weak spots, and change the battlefield. Railgunner is the ultimate boss killer. Instead of cutting down hordes, she eliminates her target in one shot.\nMastering Railgunner’s positioning and movement unleash her true potential. Throw down a Concussion Device to reach an overlook, or to get out of a challenging situation. Railgunner is instantly unlocked for owners of Survivors of the Void.\nTurn the corruption in your favor and harness the power of The Void. A corrupted commando is torn between controlling his new powers and being consumed by them. The Void Fiend is the second new survivor in Survivors of the Void. As the corruption overtakes you, abilities are twisted into more powerful attacks for a short time.\nDrown enemies with a flood of beams and missiles, and master new movement possibilities. Time your corruption, harness the void, unleash the Void Fiend. Unlock the Void Fiend by overcoming a new threat in Survivors of the Void.\nCorrupt familiar items and unlock new powers! Receiving one of the 14 Void Items permanently alters all normal versions of that item. Corruption brings power, but it also brings changes. You’ll find that many items now do the opposite of what they once did. The Void ukulele’s electrifying music targets single enemies instead of crowds. Some items do something completely different!\nUnlock 5 pieces of equipment, 4 lunar items, and 18 standard items in Survivors of the Void.\nMore of Providence’s creatures are loose and they’re not thrilled by this threat to their world. The gelatinous Gup has returned, and he’s brought some new friends from the far reaches of Petrichor V. Beware this adorable orange abomination, tread too close and it’s likely to bounce you off a cliff.\nThe most powerful creatures come from The Void. Your ability to reach The Void threatens them. That encroachment won't go unanswered. Constructs of hulking power and corrupted mind have been sent to capture you. Uncover the root of their strength, and if you can, take the fight to them.\nUnfamiliar places on Petrichor V have been discovered! Traverse new stages, uncover their secrets, and infiltrate The Void. Explore the beautiful waterfalls of Aphelian Sanctuary, take in the pungent odor of the Sulfur Pools, and enjoy accidental ice skating in Siphoned Forest.",

    "game_title": "ARK: Survival Evolved",
    "description": "As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!\nDinosaurs, Creatures, & Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!\nYou must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!\nBy chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\nPick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!\nBy bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.\nCreate a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!\nAll items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new \"Engrams\" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D \"Explorer Notes\". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!\nEverything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!\nThe mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct & draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.\nOn the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises.\nYou can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create!\nThe over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting & global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) & true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

    "description": "The Isle is intended to be a gritty, open-world survival horror game. Explore vast landscapes of dense forest and open plains, traverse treacherous mountains and wade through dark swamps where horrors lurk. Hidden within are ruins that hold insight as to what came before. Through it all, keep in mind there is only one goal: survive.\nThere is little in the way of hand holding or ulterior precepts to alter play styles or purpose. It's kill or be killed. In the end, the only one you can trust is yourself. Over the course of development the islands and their inhabitants will radically change, ever-evolving as players themselves learn how to flourish and thrive. Your mistakes will be punished. Expect no survivors.\nBecome the beast within. When joining The Isle, you can play as one of dozens of unique creatures, from tiny darting herbivores like Dryosaurus to blood-thirsty giants such as T. Rex or Allosaurus (with many more still to come!) As a dinosaur, you'll be the epitome of majestic, cunning and ferocious. Use your natural abilities and senses to stay off the menu and grow into a stronger, more capable creature.\nEngage with a living prehistoric ecosystem as you become either predator or prey on servers featuring up to 100+ players, all of them as hungry and dangerous as you. Form packs/herds, create nests, defend your offspring, hunt, and claim territory. A single mistake can spell your demise.\nThe Isle's core game mode is Survival, a tense and difficult experience where you need to grow fast or die young. Dinosaurs in Survival mode progress through several life stages, starting out small and vulnerable. Use your scent ability, night vision and wits to survive long enough to grow, becoming more powerful and unlock new abilities such as nesting. Because of the time needed to develop a full character life cycle, not every creature is or will be playable in Survival, though more will be added in future updates.\nHowever, sometimes you don't want to struggle to survive, or you don't have the time to go through a dinosaur's whole life story. And that's okay. For players who want a less intense experience, Sandbox mode lets you play an expanded roster of dinosaurs (and soon humans!). You can jump right in as an adult super predator or a peaceful giant, with no major penalties or consequences from dying. We won't judge.\nThe Isle features a narrative told strictly through the environment, achievable only through immense cooperation among players. Are you stranded? Can you just leave? What is AE? How did the dinosaurs get here? What is the distant call that pierces the night?\nIt will take the entire community to answer these mysteries and unravel the purpose to their being on The Isle, and each discovery will directly affect the future of the game's storyline.\nWe realize that there is a long road ahead, and a lot of work to be done to turn this into the game we want it to be. Throughout development, we will be adding a lot more to The Isle and incorporating user feedback in how we evolve the experience. Some of our planned features include:\nPlayable aquatic and aerial creatures\nEven more playable dinosaurs with complete life cycles\nTwo new playable factions: modern humans & the indigenous\nEvolve into advanced \"strain\" versions of certain dinosaurs\nRealistic dinosaur AI that uses complex behaviours\nAdditional world biome types such as thick jungles\nDynamic aerial drop-in spawn system\nGlobal in-game world quest\nLocalization of all in-game menus & text\nBetter accessibility & customization options\nSteam Achievements, Trading Cards, Emotes\nMod support using Steam Workshop\nAll that and more are on our radar going forward. We started with a plan of just a mere handful of playable carnivores, but based on player demand we expanded our scope, increased that number greatly and introduced herbivorous dinosaurs as well. Listening to our community has been instrumental in guiding our process and helped to correct our mistakes, and we hope that together we can transform The Isle into the ultimate dinosaur game.\n--AE Core TX Received--\n--End Promotional Protocol--\n--SiGnaL InTeRrUpt--\n-tHEeNdISnevErTheENDisNeVeRtHeEnDIsNev\n-",

To be controlled, that is.\nRuling over the Central Provinces of Cathay, Yuan Bo, the Jade Dragon leads the Court of Celestial Sorcerers. A bureaucrat of the highest order on the surface, yes, but a talented spymaster at heart, the Jade Dragon runs the city of Wei-jin and, by extension, is an administrator for the Cathay empire.

For those seeking a magical touch, the Jade Lion is a conduit of sorcery, ​​able to use spells bound to its body and launch flaming attacks. The Jet Lion, however, is the opposite, countering magical spells to diminish any sorcery that may harm themselves or those nearby.\nCONTENT OVERVIEW\n•\t1 Legendary Lord\n•\t1 Legendary Hero\n•\t1 Lord\n•\t1 Hero\n•\t6 Battle Units\n•\t3 Regiments of Renown\n•\tNew gameplay mechanics and features\n•\tPlayable in Immortal Empires and Realms of Chaos",

Then one day, in my twentieth winter, I got too close to the woods. And when I was told Mother Ostankya would get you... I knew if I took one step closer to the trees it would be true.\nTales of monsters and bogeymen have haunted many lands for centuries, but the tale hanging above the Kislevite children, a reminder of the consequences for displaying disobedience, was not just a tale. Mother Ostankya is real. A guardian, faithful to the land, holding anyone who seeks to harm it accountable, she draws her power from the very woods, fens and oblasts that she protects. When war comes to her door, she’ll be on the front lines, protecting the warriors of Kislev, and inflicting her terror upon any who oppose them.\nAnd if you cross her path, make no mistake. Mother Ostankya will punish you.\nAs a powerful sorceress with a bespoke melee component, Mother Ostankya utilises her cauldron on and off the battlefield, able to rain spirits down upon her foes from afar or sprout the legs of a spider in melee combat as an artillery-chariot hybrid.\nThe Daughters of the Forest must infuse Mother Ostankya’s Witchcraft at the Witch’s Hut. With a new rare resource, Spirit Essence, you can take advantage of ingredients gathered during your playthrough to create potent Incantations and utilise Hexes to vastly change the course of your entire campaign.\nForce enemy armies from your lands in an instant, purge entire provinces of corruption in a single move, buff your units far beyond their given capability, and unleash the full might of the witch as you search for the Malediction of Ruin; Mother Ostankya’s final Hex to secure the sanctity of Kislevite land.\nNew Kislevite units lurk in these woods.\nA terrible and frightening creature, known to many as The Thing in the Woods, brings its enormous size and infantry sundering capability to the frontlines of Kislev. Left unchecked, this beast will tear through enemy troops like paper, before rushing into the woods for cover and emerging to do it all over again.\nCONTENT OVERVIEW\n•\t1 Legendary Lord\n•\t1 Legendary Hero\n•\t1 Lord\n•\t1 Hero\n•\t5 Battle Units\n•\t3 Regiments of Renown\n•\tNew gameplay mechanics and features\n•\tPlayable in Immortal Empires and Realms of Chaos",

    "description": "This pack introduces the Changeling, a new Legendary Lord for Tzeentch, usable in both Realm of Chaos and Immortal Empires campaigns, as well as new units, characters, and regiments of renown.\n• Enact malign schemes and trickery with the Changeling of Tzeentch.\n• Scatter magical spells far and wide with the Blue Scribes of Tzeentch; a new Legendary Hero.\n​​• ​Expand your roster with 5 additional nits, and enhance your troops with 3 new Regiments of Renown, including the Chaos Lord of Tzeentch, Tzaangors, Changebringers, and the Mutalith Vortex Beast.\nI make my home in the darkest pits of your soul. In the shadows, I bide my time.\nAs the shape-shifting agent of misrule, the Changeling embodies the Changer of Ways’ most deceiving and manipulative tendencies. Able to take the form of any legendary character from the noble to the fearsome, none, save perhaps Tzeentch himself, know the Changeling's true form. His trickery may even deceive the Dark Gods themselves, able to mirror foes, create false allies, and disrupt empires from within, with only one truth becoming clear long after he’s enacted his handiwork.\nThe perplexing prankster of the known world, the Changeling of Tzeentch, was here.\nAs a spellcasting shapeshifter bolstering the Lore of Tzeentch, the Changeling can adopt the form of any lord he faces, making his battle efficiency grow stronger as your enemy tries to do the same. When not fighting directly, he lingers in the shadows, stalking his prey, and waiting for the optimal time to strike.\nTrust no one.\nThe Changeling’s inscrutable and deceiving nature is the perfect recipe for schemes and trickery. For the Changeling, the world is divided into Theatres; segmented regions that contain Schemes, both minor and pivotal. Fuelled by an unending legion of tricksy cultists, to achieve his goals he must first break a Theatre down through smaller, cheekier Schemes by constructing buildings, stealing identities, and instigating tensions amongst otherwise civilized populations, culminating in a Grand Scheme and an epic battle for supremacy, rife with bountiful rewards along the way.\nGold, Grimoires, and Rifts aplenty.\nWith enough Grand Schemes carried out, the Changeling’s final purpose is within reach: conducting the Ultimate Scheme for campaign victory.\nThis troublesome Legendary Hero, the Blue Scribes, ride atop their Disc of Tzeentch, scribbling on parchment as they go, and are capable of spewing all manner of spells across the battlefield by verbalising their scrolls. If only they knew what those words meant...\nCONTENT OVERVIEW\n•\t1 Legendary Lord\n•\t1 Legendary Hero\n•\t1 Lord\n•\t1 Hero\n•\t5 Battle Units\n•\t3 Regiments of Renown\n•\tNew gameplay mechanics and features\n•\tPlayable in Immortal Empires and Realms of Chaos",

    "description": "Welcome home! The award-winning sci-fi city builder is back - remastered, expanded, and more stunning than ever. Your mission: colonize Mars and survive the process, from exploration and infrastructure to welcoming human colonists and achieving long-term stability. There are new challenges to overcome, new strategies to plan, and now with an upgraded look and feel for a new generation of explorers.\nAll you need for this relaunched mission to create a thriving Martian settlement is a steady supply of resources, oxygen, decades of training, experience with sandstorms… and a curious attitude to discover the purpose of those weird black cubes that appeared out of nowhere. With a bit of sprucing up, this place is going to be awesome!\nSurviving Mars: Relaunched\nbrings together the original colony management game from Haemimont Games, its entire catalogue of expansions, improved and reworked, from major expansions to cosmetics and radio stations, as well as the all-new Martian Assembly update. Upgraded graphics together with updated UI will give veteran players the definitive Surviving Mars experience, and provide an ideal launch point for new commanders as well.\nAre you ready? Mars is waiting for you.\nThe new Martian Assembly brings an expanded endgame challenge never seen in the original. Shape your Martian society through laws. Balance the needs and demands of your colonists, keep the peace and develop a long-term plan for Mars - up to and including independence from Earth!\nBuilding a thriving colony on a planet not fit for human life brings its own challenges. Construct life-support systems, power grids, domes, and supply chains, and keep them running, because blackouts on a planet without oxygen are never a good idea. And you’re not alone. With the included ‘\nSpace Race\n’ expansion, rival colonies backed by competing sponsors add even more pressure as you fight for resources and the future of Mars.\nBalance critical resources like oxygen, water, power, and food to keep your colony alive. Drones build and maintain your infrastructure, while the revamped ‘\nMartian Express\n’ adds trains that move people and supplies across longer distances. Every colonist has their own needs and behaviors and smart management is essential for their survival.\nAdvance your colony through a deep research system that unlocks new buildings, production methods, and essential upgrades. Discover breakthroughs, resources, and hidden secrets reaching ‘\nBelow & Beyond\n’ the Martian surface. With randomized maps, varied sponsors, and unpredictable Mysteries, every playthrough offers new challenges, and every decision shapes your story of survival and growth on Mars.\nTerraforming is no longer a distant dream, it’s your next challenge. With the included ‘\nGreen Planet\n’ expansion, you can engineer Mars into a more habitable world. As the environment transforms, introduce animal life with ‘\nProject Laika\n’, bringing the first creatures to thrive alongside your colonists. The future of Mars isn’t just survival, it’s building a self-sustaining, living planet.",

Systems will be captured and reclaimed, major events will unfold, and new technologies will come to light.\nThe rigors of war will be seen with each passing week as your relationships with the various factions fluctuate according to the relentless Succession Wars and your choices as the leader of a Mercenary outfit.\nGAMEPLAY\nThe battlefields of the future are dominated by BattleMechs, hulking machines of war capable of leveling entire cities. As a BattleMech pilot you’ll rain havoc upon enemy ‘Mechs and targets, including tanks, ground vehicles, aircraft, advanced defenses, and reinforced bases.\nFew things can withstand the power of a ‘Mech for long, and the worlds of the Inner Sphere are veritable playgrounds of destruction awaiting your shielding defense or crushing devastation.\nBATTLEMECHS\n\"With over 50 unique ‘Mech chassis and hundreds of sub-variants, all fully-realized with high-fidelity models, damage states, and equipment, no two ‘Mechs are the same!\nWhether acquired from scouring the markets of the Inner Sphere for rare and valuable chassis and equipment, or salvaging directly from the wreckage of your annihilated enemies and the spoils of war, the maintenance and operation of your BattleMechs will be vital to your success both as a MechWarrior and a Mercenary outfit commander.\"\nTHE MERC LIFE\nOff the battlefield, as the leader of a Mercenary company you will need to manage all the key components of running a unit.\nYou’ll need to maintain and acquire ‘Mechs and equipment, hire and field MechWarriors from throughout the Inner Sphere to join you on the battlefield, and manage your relationships with the Great Houses of the Inner Sphere, all of whom are vying for your contribution to their staggering war efforts.\nOf course, with each Contract comes negotiation, and with each victory comes consequence.\nOTHER FEATURES\nWith the vast scope of the Inner Sphere and its complex system of world generation providing huge variety and replayability, the MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries experience offers no end.
